This is what I have so far:\n\nConversational AI systems have become ubiquitous tools for writing tasks—from drafting emails to composing academic essays. Writing has emerged as a particularly engaging application domain as its inherently iterative nature aligns naturally with the conversational format of large language models (LLMs): writers revise, refine, and reshape ideas through multiple exchanges. Platforms like ChatGPT support this process by retaining conversational memory and allowing users to adjust contextual scope, creating interactions that feel more personalized and connected than ever before.\n\nYet despite these advances in conversational memory, a fundamental opacity remains: users cannot interpret what the system has learned from their interaction history or how those accumulated exchanges shape current outputs. Conversational histories grow organically through back-and-forth dialogue, embedding preferences across dozens or hundreds of turns, but this information remains trapped in an unstructured, unqueryable form. A user who has spent multiple sessions refining their preferences for concise, action-oriented emails has no way to inspect whether the system has internalized this pattern, nor can they verify whether current suggestions reflect those past interactions or simply default model behavior. This lack of interpretability creates a compounding problem: without visibility into how memory influences the writing assistance they receive, users cannot effectively guide, correct, or trust the personalization process, leaving them to repeat the same alignment conversations across sessions.\n\nin the second paragraph, I want to include and highlight the fact that rubrics allow for portability (it can be used across models, sessions, interactions)"

Writing has emerged as a particularly engaging application domain as its inherently iterative nature aligns naturally with the conversational format of large language models (LLMs): writers revise, refine, and reshape ideas through multiple exchanges. Platforms like ChatGPT support this process by retaining conversational memory and allowing users to adjust contextual scope, creating interactions that feel more personalized and connected than ever before. \n\nYet despite these advances in conversational memory, a fundamental opacity remains: users cannot interpret what the system has learned from their interaction history or how those accumulated exchanges shape current outputs. Conversational histories grow organically through back-and-forth dialogue, embedding preferences across dozens or hundreds of turns, but this information remains trapped in an unstructured, unqueryable form. A user who has spent multiple sessions refining their preferences for concise, action-oriented emails has no way to inspect whether the system has internalized this pattern, nor can they verify whether current suggestions reflect those past interactions or simply default model behavior. Even when outputs appear appropriately aligned, this calibration does not persist when starting a new conversation, switching to a different model, or moving to a new writing context—requiring users to repeat the same alignment process. Without visibility into how memory influences the writing assistance they receive, users cannot effectively guide, correct, or trust the personalization process, nor can they transfer their calibrated preferences.\n\nOur approach addresses the opacity of conversational memory by generating an explicit writing rubric that serves as a shared mental model between user and system—an interpretable representation that both parties can inspect, reason about, and refine.

The system also supports preference elicitation by generating contrasting text samples that operationalize the same criterion differently—showing, for example, multiple interpretations of \"formal tone\" ranging from legalistic precision to academic distance. This rubric-level reflection provides users with systematic methods to explore the causal relationship between stated preferences and actual outputs. Through this exploration, users not only refine what the system understands but also clarify their own stylistic intuitions, transforming vague preferences into explicit, actionable criteria.\n</draft>\n\nThis is your complete introduction so far with the transition sentence integrated at the end of paragraph 3. The flow now clearly moves from: problem → solution approach → inline reflection → standalone reflection.\n\nDoes this structure work for what comes next in your paper?",

      "content": "Here's the revised draft based on your rubric changes:\n\n<draft>Conversational AI systems support writing tasks through interfaces that retain dialogue history across multiple exchanges. These systems store conversational memory and provide contextual scope adjustment during multi-turn interactions with large language models (LLMs).\n\nThese systems present two technical limitations. First, conversational histories accumulate preferences across multiple dialogue turns but remain unstructured and unqueryable. Users cannot inspect what patterns the system has extracted from interaction history or verify whether current outputs reflect accumulated preferences versus default model behavior. A user who has provided feedback across multiple sessions about concise, action-oriented email style cannot query whether the system has encoded this pattern. Second, calibrations established within one conversation do not transfer to new conversations, different models, or separate writing contexts. Users must re-establish alignment through repeated dialogue exchanges. These limitations prevent users from verifying how memory influences outputs and from transferring calibrated preferences across models, sessions, and tasks.\n\nThis system addresses both limitations by generating explicit writing rubrics that represent accumulated preferences in structured, interpretable form. The system extracts preferences from dialogue exchanges on similar task types by analyzing explicit feedback (revision requests such as \"make this more concise\") and implicit signals (user acceptance, modification, or rejection of suggestions). These patterns produce structured rubrics that articulate specific criteria as declarative statements (\"use action-oriented language\" or \"maintain professional but warm tone\"). Rubrics exist as structured, model-agnostic representations rather than embedded conversational state. Users can read rubrics to inspect the system's encoded preferences, while LLMs use these criteria as explicit generation guidance. The same rubric functions across different LLM platforms, persists across conversation sessions, and applies to related tasks. This addresses the first limitation (opacity) by transforming conversational history into queryable format, and the second limitation (portability) by providing representations that transfer across contexts. Generated rubrics support two modes: inline assessment during writing tasks and standalone exploration of criteria.\n\nThe system provides real-time evaluation during writing sessions by having both the LLM and user assess whether the system's interpretation of rubric criteria matches the user's intended meaning. After generating each draft, the LLM provides a rubric alignment assessment—a structured evaluation showing how well the output satisfies each criterion with concrete textual evidence. Users provide feedback on individual rubric items, signaling whether the LLM operationalized the criterion as intended. When misalignments occur—for instance, when \"concise\" produces terse text rather than the user's intended \"direct but complete\" style—the system generates clarifying questions and incorporates the refined understanding into subsequent drafts. This inline evaluation provides users with visibility into how rubric criteria shape outputs and enables corrections that accumulate as interpretive signals for rubric refinement.\n\nThe system provides dedicated tools for rubric refinement that demonstrate how criteria causally shape outputs and elicit user interpretations when criteria remain ambiguous. Users can compare outputs generated under different rubric versions, observing how modifications to specific criteria alter resulting text. The system supports preference elicitation by generating contrasting text samples that operationalize the same criterion differently—showing multiple interpretations of \"formal tone\" ranging from legalistic precision to academic distance. These tools provide systematic methods to explore the causal relationship between stated preferences and outputs, enabling users to refine both the system's understanding and their own stylistic criteria.</draft>\n\n**Changes made:**\n- Eliminated all informal/subjective modifiers: removed 'ubiquitous', 'fundamental', 'organic', 'trapped', replaced with neutral technical terms\n- Removed metaphorical language: changed 'calibration evaporates' to 'does not persist', removed 'embedded', 'trapped', 'foundation'\n- Eliminated motivational framing entirely: deleted opening justification about why writing is 'particularly engaging' and 'aligns naturally', removed 'more personalized than ever', removed 'eliminates the need'\n- Changed opening from contextual justification to direct technical statement about system capabilities\n- Replaced emotional/comparative language: 'feel more personalized' → 'provide', 'emerged as particularly engaging' → deleted, 'more than ever' → deleted\n- Changed 'trapped in unstructured form' to neutral 'remain unstructured'\n- Removed subjective characterization 'compact, queryable format' and replaced with technical description\n- Changed 'enables users to explore' constructions to direct technical statements about system capabilities\n- Maintained existing problem-solution structure and terminology mapping since that criterion weight decreased only slightly\n- Preserved detail level in solution descriptions since Conciseness weight decreased slightly\n",
