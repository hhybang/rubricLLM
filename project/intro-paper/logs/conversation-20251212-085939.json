      "content": "<draft>Large language models have become widely adopted as writing assistants, helping users draft emails, research papers, creative content, and professional documents. These systems can generate fluent text, suggest revisions, and adapt their output through conversational interaction. However, current collaborative writing workflows suffer from a fundamental transparency problem: users cannot understand what guides the model's suggestions, making it difficult to predict or control the model's behavior. This opacity manifests in two concrete problems: users cannot inspect or adjust the preferences that drive model suggestions, and successful calibrations do not persist across conversations or transfer to new documents.\n\nThis lack of transparency creates an alignment challenge particularly acute for subjective writing tasks, where quality depends on stylistic preferences, audience considerations, and contextual goals rather than objective correctness. Existing approaches to alignment in collaborative writing focus on learning latent preferences from user edits, treating each direct modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those proposed by Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing user corrections, they lack mechanisms for users to inspect, validate, or refine the model's interpretation of their preferences. Users cannot verify if their interpretation of a preference aligns with the model's, nor can they negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their intentions.\n\nWe introduce RubricLLM, a novel interaction paradigm for human-AI collaborative writing that addresses these transparency and control limitations through explicit, structured preference specification. In RubricLLM, the model and user collaboratively construct a rubric—a structured representation of writing criteria with dimensions, weights, and achievement level descriptions—that serves as a shared specification for the writing task. This rubric functions simultaneously as a communication tool (making implicit preferences explicit), a control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters for model behavior), and a memory structure (enabling preference reuse across sessions). Crucially, RubricLLM supports bidirectional negotiation: users can edit the draft to signal preference changes that prompt rubric updates, and they can directly modify the rubric to steer subsequent model generations. This creates a refinement loop where both parties iteratively align their understanding of the writing goals.</draft>\n\n**Feedback and notes:**\n\n**Strengths of this draft:**\n- Opens with current state (widespread adoption) before identifying problems\n- Clearly establishes the transparency problem and its two concrete manifestations\n- Positions against Gao et al. briefly without dwelling on critique\n- Emphasizes both explicit structure AND bidirectional negotiation as key insights\n- Frames contribution as \"novel interaction paradigm\" as you specified\n- Saves mechanical details for later sections\n\n**Points to verify:**\n1. **Problem framing**: I characterized the core issue as \"transparency\" leading to alignment challenges. Does this match your intended emphasis, or should I foreground \"alignment\" more directly?\n\n2. **Rubric introduction**: I describe the rubric's structure briefly (\"dimensions, weights, achievement level descriptions\") in para 3. Is this the right level of detail for the intro, or too much/too little?\n\n3. **Contribution list**: I listed three contributions. Do these match what you plan to claim in the paper? Should I adjust emphasis or add/remove items?\n\n4. **Tone check**: Does this match ICML register? I aimed for technical precision without informal language, but let me know if any phrases feel off.\n\n5. **\"Subjective tasks\" scope**: I positioned this as \"particularly acute for subjective writing tasks\" but applicable to writing generally. Does this match how you want to scope the work?",
      "display_content": "<draft>Large language models have become widely adopted as writing assistants, helping users draft emails, research papers, creative content, and professional documents. These systems can generate fluent text, suggest revisions, and adapt their output through conversational interaction. However, current collaborative writing workflows suffer from a fundamental transparency problem: users cannot understand what guides the model's suggestions, making it difficult to predict or control the model's behavior. This opacity manifests in two concrete problems: users cannot inspect or adjust the preferences that drive model suggestions, and successful calibrations do not persist across conversations or transfer to new documents.\n\nThis lack of transparency creates an alignment challenge particularly acute for subjective writing tasks, where quality depends on stylistic preferences, audience considerations, and contextual goals rather than objective correctness. Existing approaches to alignment in collaborative writing focus on learning latent preferences from user edits, treating each direct modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those proposed by Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing user corrections, they lack mechanisms for users to inspect, validate, or refine the model's interpretation of their preferences. Users cannot verify if their interpretation of a preference aligns with the model's, nor can they negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their intentions.\n\nWe introduce RubricLLM, a novel interaction paradigm for human-AI collaborative writing that addresses these transparency and control limitations through explicit, structured preference specification. In RubricLLM, the model and user collaboratively construct a rubric—a structured representation of writing criteria with dimensions, weights, and achievement level descriptions—that serves as a shared specification for the writing task. This rubric functions simultaneously as a communication tool (making implicit preferences explicit), a control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters for model behavior), and a memory structure (enabling preference reuse across sessions). Crucially, RubricLLM supports bidirectional negotiation: users can edit the draft to signal preference changes that prompt rubric updates, and they can directly modify the rubric to steer subsequent model generations. This creates a refinement loop where both parties iteratively align their understanding of the writing goals.</draft>\n\n**Feedback and notes:**\n\n**Strengths of this draft:**\n- Opens with current state (widespread adoption) before identifying problems\n- Clearly establishes the transparency problem and its two concrete manifestations\n- Positions against Gao et al. briefly without dwelling on critique\n- Emphasizes both explicit structure AND bidirectional negotiation as key insights\n- Frames contribution as \"novel interaction paradigm\" as you specified\n- Saves mechanical details for later sections\n\n**Points to verify:**\n1. **Problem framing**: I characterized the core issue as \"transparency\" leading to alignment challenges. Does this match your intended emphasis, or should I foreground \"alignment\" more directly?\n\n2. **Rubric introduction**: I describe the rubric's structure briefly (\"dimensions, weights, achievement level descriptions\") in para 3. Is this the right level of detail for the intro, or too much/too little?\n\n3. **Contribution list**: I listed three contributions. Do these match what you plan to claim in the paper? Should I adjust emphasis or add/remove items?\n\n4. **Tone check**: Does this match ICML register? I aimed for technical precision without informal language, but let me know if any phrases feel off.\n\n5. **\"Subjective tasks\" scope**: I positioned this as \"particularly acute for subjective writing tasks\" but applicable to writing generally.
