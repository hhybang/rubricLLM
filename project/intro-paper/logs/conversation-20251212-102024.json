Existing approaches to alignment in collaborative writing focus on learning latent preferences from user edits, treating each direct modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those proposed by Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing user corrections, they lack mechanisms for users to inspect, validate, or refine the model's interpretation of their preferences.

        "evaluation_text": "### Academic Register Consistency\n**Weight**: 25%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 18.75\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Successfully eliminated most low-value modifiers: \"widely adopted\" → \"adopted\", \"fundamental opacity problem\" → \"opacity in their guiding criteria\", \"concrete failures\" → \"failures\", \"novel paradigm\" → \"paradigm\"\n- Replaced metaphorical language with literal descriptions: \"calibrations vanish\" → \"calibrations...do not persist\"\n- Removed subjective framing: \"poses a challenge\" → \"affects\"\n- However, retained one metaphor: \"transparency gap\" (paragraph 2 opening)\n- Maintained neutral tone throughout with objective technical language\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient rather than Exemplary due to the single retained metaphor \"transparency gap\" in paragraph 2. The rubric's Exemplary descriptor specifies \"All metaphors replaced with literal descriptions (e.g., 'transparency gap' → 'lack of transparency').\" This is explicitly listed as a required change. The draft successfully eliminates all other instances of low-value modifiers, metaphorical language, and subjective framing, meeting the Proficient standard of \"no more than one low-value modifier per paragraph; metaphors limited to conventional technical terms; predominantly neutral tone.\"\n\n**To reach next level**:\nReplace \"This transparency gap\" with \"This lack of transparency\" in the opening of paragraph 2. This is the only remaining instance of metaphorical phrasing that prevents achievement of the Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 opens with \"This lack of transparency\" explicitly referencing para 1's \"opacity\" problem using parallel terminology\n- Para 3 opens with \"makes preferences explicit\" directly contrasting para 2's \"implicit feedback\" and referencing the transparency problem\n- Solution elements directly map to stated problems using consistent terms:\n  - Problem: \"cannot inspect what criteria guide\" → Solution: \"surfacing implicit preferences\"\n  - Problem: \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions\" → Solution: \"memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\"\n  - Problem: \"cannot...adjust those criteria\" → Solution: \"control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters)\"\n- Every major claim includes backward-looking connective language\n- Reader can predict paragraph content from opening sentences\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking connections. The topic sentences use precise terminology that references prior arguments (\"This lack of transparency\", \"makes preferences explicit\"). The solution paragraph demonstrates 100% mapping between problem dimensions and solution elements using parallel terminology. The logical progression is transparent and requires no reader inference.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Precision and Conciseness Balance\n**Weight**: 30%\n**Achievement Level**: Developing (50%)\n**Weighted Score**: 15\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- **Repetitive formulations identified**:\n  - Para 1: \"users cannot inspect what criteria guide the model's suggestions or adjust those criteria\" → \"users cannot predict or control model behavior\" (control/adjust are restated)\n  - Para 3: \"(surfacing implicit preferences)\" immediately follows \"makes preferences explicit\" (same concept, different words)\n  - Para 3: \"shared specification of their writing task\" is elaborated with three parenthetical restatements: \"(surfacing implicit preferences), control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters), and memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\" - these functions are elaborative examples that restate the core concept of \"shared specification\"\n  \n- **Lack of clarifying specifications where needed**:\n  - \"adapt through conversational interaction\" (para 1) - what kind of adaptation? Style? Content? Tone?\n  - \"observing corrections\" (para 2) - what kinds of corrections? All edits, or specific types?\n  \n- **Sentence efficiency issues**:\n  - Para 3, final sentence restates the bidirectional concept already established: \"This creates an iterative alignment loop where both parties converge on shared understanding\" adds minimal new information beyond \"bidirectional negotiation\" already stated\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft shows Developing rather than Proficient because it contains multiple instances of concepts restated with minor word changes throughout. The rubric's Developing descriptor specifies \"Multiple instances of concepts restated with minor word changes; occasionally sacrifices precision for brevity; some sentences primarily repackage prior sentences.\" This accurately describes the draft. Paragraph 3 is particularly repetitive, with \"shared specification\" explained multiple times through elaborative examples that don't add meaningful precision. The draft would need to eliminate these redundancies to reach Proficient.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n1. Remove or consolidate redundant formulations: eliminate \"predict or control\" (redundant with \"adjust criteria\"), consolidate the three parenthetical functions in para 3\n2. Cut the final sentence of para 3 or revise to introduce genuinely new information\n3. Add clarifying specifications where they prevent ambiguity (e.g., specify what kind of adaptation in para 1)\n\n---\n\n### Problem-Solution Alignment\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- **Problem dimensions in para 1**:\n  1. \"cannot inspect what criteria guide the model's suggestions\"\n  2. \"cannot...adjust those criteria to match their goals\"\n  3. \"cannot predict or control model behavior during collaboration\"\n  4. \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions or documents\"\n\n- **Solution elements in para 3 with parallel terminology**:\n  1. \"communication tool (surfacing implicit preferences)\" → addresses inability to inspect criteria\n  2. \"control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters)\" → addresses inability to adjust criteria\n  3. \"bidirectional negotiation: draft edits can trigger rubric refinement suggestions, while rubric modifications steer subsequent generations\" → addresses inability to predict/control\n  4. \"memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\" → addresses calibrations not persisting\n\n- **Additional problem from para 2**:\n  - \"no mechanism for users to validate the model's interpretation of their preferences or negotiate\" → addressed by \"bidirectional negotiation\" and \"converge on shared understanding\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every problem dimension has a corresponding solution element using consistent terminology. The mapping is transparent and requires no inference. The solution paragraph explicitly names concepts (\"control mechanism\", \"memory structure\", \"cross-session reuse\") that directly parallel problem statements (\"adjust criteria\", \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions\"). The 1:1 mapping meets the Exemplary descriptor: \"Every problem dimension mentioned in problem statement has corresponding solution element in solution paragraph using same terminology.\"\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.",

They've now asked for a formal assessment of how well the current draft aligns with their rubric. Review the conversation history to understand:\n- The original writing goal and any constraints mentioned\n- How the draft evolved through our discussion\n- What the user explicitly valued or requested\n\nThen assess the **final draft** (the most recent assistant message) against each criterion in the rubric.\n\n## Scoring System\n\nEach criterion uses a four-level achievement scale:\n- **Exemplary (100%)**: Fully realizes the user's vision for this criterion; they'd approve with minimal or no changes\n- **Proficient (75%)**: Meets the core requirements; would satisfy user with minor polish\n- **Developing (50%)**: Shows awareness of user's goals but needs significant revision to meet their standards\n- **Beginning (25%)**: Misses or contradicts what the user values for this criterion\n\n**Overall Score Calculation:**\n1. Assign each criterion a level (25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%)\n2. Multiply by that criterion's weight\n3. Sum all weighted scores for the overall score out of 100\n\n## Evaluation Process\n\nFor each criterion in the rubric:\n\n1. **Read the criterion carefully**: Understand what THIS specific user values (not generic writing quality)\n\n2. **Review the achievement level descriptors**: Each criterion has four levels with specific, observable features. Note what distinguishes each level.\n\n3. **Examine the draft**: Look for evidence of the features described in each level. Consider:\n   - Direct quotes that exemplify or violate the criterion\n   - Structural patterns (organization, flow, balance)\n   - Tone, style, and rhetorical choices\n   - What's present AND what's missing\n\n4. **Choose the best-matching level**: Select the level whose descriptors most accurately describe what you observe in the draft. When between two levels:\n   - **Beginning vs. Developing**: Does it show awareness of the user's goal?\n   - **Developing vs. Proficient**: Would the user need substantial rework, or just polish?\n   - **Proficient vs. Exemplary**: Does it fully realize their vision, or just meet requirements?\n\n5. **Document your reasoning**: Provide specific evidence and explain why this level fits better than adjacent levels.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\nWrap your detailed evaluation in `<evaluation>` tags, following this structure for EACH criterion:\n\n### [Criterion Name from Rubric]\n**Weight**: [X%]\n**Achievement Level**: [Level Name] ([percentage]%)\n**Weighted Score**: [percentage × weight / 100]\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- [Specific quote, example, or observation from the draft]\n- [Another piece of concrete evidence]\n- [Continue with all relevant evidence]\n\n**Rationale**:\n[Explain why you chose this level over adjacent levels. Reference the specific descriptors from the rubric's achievement levels. Be concrete about what features you observed or what was missing.]\n\n**To reach next level**:\n[If not Exemplary: Describe the specific, actionable changes needed to reach the next achievement level. Reference what the next level's descriptors require that the current draft lacks.]\n\n---\n\n[Repeat the above structure for EVERY criterion in the rubric]\n\n## After All Criteria\n\nAfter completing the evaluation for all criteria, provide a JSON summary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_score\": <sum of all weighted scores, out of 100>,\n  \"score_interpretation\": \"<Exceptional (90+) | Strong (80-89) | Solid (70-79) | Developing (50-69) | Emerging (<50)>\",\n  \"criteria_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"<exact criterion name from rubric>\",\n      \"weight\": <weight as integer>,\n      \"achievement_level\": \"<Exemplary|Proficient|Developing|Beginning>\",\n      \"level_percentage\": <25|50|75|100>,\n      \"weighted_score\": <level_percentage × weight / 100>,\n      \"evidence_summary\": \"<1-2 sentence summary of key evidence>\"\n    }\n    // Include ALL criteria\n  ],\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"<2-3 sentences: Does this draft align with the user's demonstrated values?

The rubric's Exemplary descriptor specifies \"All metaphors replaced with literal descriptions (e.g., 'transparency gap' → 'lack of transparency').\" This is explicitly listed as a required change. The draft successfully eliminates all other instances of low-value modifiers, metaphorical language, and subjective framing, meeting the Proficient standard of \"no more than one low-value modifier per paragraph; metaphors limited to conventional technical terms; predominantly neutral tone.\"\n\n**To reach next level**:\nReplace \"This transparency gap\" with \"This lack of transparency\" in the opening of paragraph 2. This is the only remaining instance of metaphorical phrasing that prevents achievement of the Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 opens with \"This lack of transparency\" explicitly referencing para 1's \"opacity\" problem using parallel terminology\n- Para 3 opens with \"makes preferences explicit\" directly contrasting para 2's \"implicit feedback\" and referencing the transparency problem\n- Solution elements directly map to stated problems using consistent terms:\n  - Problem: \"cannot inspect what criteria guide\" → Solution: \"surfacing implicit preferences\"\n  - Problem: \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions\" → Solution: \"memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\"\n  - Problem: \"cannot...adjust those criteria\" → Solution: \"control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters)\"\n- Every major claim includes backward-looking connective language\n- Reader can predict paragraph content from opening sentences\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking connections. The topic sentences use precise terminology that references prior arguments (\"This lack of transparency\", \"makes preferences explicit\"). The solution paragraph demonstrates 100% mapping between problem dimensions and solution elements using parallel terminology.

The rubric's Developing descriptor specifies \"Multiple instances of concepts restated with minor word changes; occasionally sacrifices precision for brevity; some sentences primarily repackage prior sentences.\" This accurately describes the draft.

Users collaborate with these models iteratively through chat interface, refining drafts through multiple exchanges until the output meets their goals. The conversational context enables personalized interaction where the model maintains memory of prior exchanges, making these interactions feel more personalized. \n\nThe personalization enabled by conversational context, however, remains opaque: users cannot inspect what context guides the model's suggestions or verify whether those learned match their intent. Existing alignment approaches attempt to address this opacity by learning latent preferences from user edits, treating each modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those of Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing corrections, they offer no way for users to validate inferred preferences or negotiate when the model's interpretation diverges from intent. Subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on stylistic preferences, audience considerations, and contextual goals rather than objective correctness—make alignment both more critical and more difficult: the absence of ground truth means explicit preference representation is essential for verifying model behavior.\n\nWe present RubricLLM, an interactive system that addresses this challenge through explicit, editable rubrics that serve as a shared specification between users and AI writing assistants. Our approach enables users to define multi-dimensional evaluation criteria—including weighted importance, achievement levels, and qualitative descriptions—that guide both draft generation and assessment. The system supports a bidirectional refinement process: users can modify rubrics to influence subsequent drafts, while the AI can suggest rubric updates based on observed user edits to generated content.

An AI-assisted rubric refinement interface supports this negotiation by enabling users to describe changes in natural language, observe the model's interpretation through proposed modifications, and preview effects in updated drafts before committing changes. Finally, users must verify that their rubric specifications produce the intended model behavior. Draft assessment against the active rubric provides criterion-level scoring that makes this verification possible, establishing accountability between specified preferences and generated output. These mechanisms work together to address the opacity problem identified earlier: by making preference representation both explicit and verifiable, RubricLLM enables users to achieve and maintain alignment with their AI writing assistant.</draft>\n\n**Key changes for better flow:**\n\n1. **Reorganized around user needs progression**: Each mechanism now follows from a stated user need (\"Users need...\", \"The process of...requires\", \"Finally, users must...\")\n\n2. **Connected mechanisms to each other**: Added transitional phrases (\"Finally\", \"before committing changes\") that show progression through the workflow\n\n3. **Eliminated semicolon list structure**: Each mechanism now gets its own sentence group with internal logic\n\n4. **Strengthened final synthesis**: Replaced generic \"Together, these mechanisms\" with \"These mechanisms work together\" and added more specific outcome language about achieving and maintaining alignment\n\n5. **Made problem→solution flow more explicit**: Each mechanism section now starts with the challenge, then introduces the solution as addressing that specific challenge\n\nDoes this flow better as a cohesive paragraph rather than a list?",

Users collaborate with these models iteratively through chat interfaces, refining drafts through multiple exchanges until the output meets their goals. The conversational context enables personalized interaction where the model maintains memory of prior exchanges.\n\nThis conversational memory creates an opacity problem: users cannot inspect what context guides the model's suggestions or verify whether learned preferences match their intent. Existing alignment approaches attempt to address this opacity through latent preference learning from user edits, treating each modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those of Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing corrections, they offer no mechanism for users to validate inferred preferences or negotiate when the model's interpretation diverges from intent. The absence of explicit preference representation in subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on stylistic preferences, audience considerations, and contextual goals rather than objective correctness—prevents users from verifying model behavior against their actual goals.\n\nWe present RubricLLM, an interactive system that addresses this lack of explicit preference representation through editable rubrics that serve as a shared specification between users and AI writing assistants. Our approach enables users to define multi-dimensional evaluation criteria—including weighted importance, achievement levels, and qualitative descriptions—that guide both draft generation and assessment. The system supports a bidirectional refinement process: users can modify rubrics to influence subsequent drafts, while the AI can suggest rubric updates based on observed user edits to generated content. This bidirectional process creates a feedback loop where preferences are progressively externalized and refined through the rubric structure.\n\nThis externalization of preferences through rubrics requires mechanisms that enable users to explore, negotiate, and verify their specifications. RubricLLM's branching workflow addresses the exploration need by preserving prior rubric states, allowing users to revert when a modification steers the model in an undesired direction. This preservation of prior states enables experimentation without risking the loss of calibrations achieved in earlier sessions. The translation of desired changes into structured rubric modifications requires negotiation between user and model to ensure shared understanding. An AI-assisted rubric refinement interface supports this negotiation by enabling users to describe changes in natural language, observe the model's interpretation through proposed modifications, and preview effects in updated drafts before committing changes. The verification of rubric specifications against actual model behavior occurs through draft assessment against the active rubric, which provides criterion-level scoring that establishes accountability between specified preferences and generated output. These three mechanisms—branching for exploration, AI-assisted refinement for negotiation, and criterion-level assessment for verification—work together to address the opacity problem by making preference representation both explicit and verifiable, enabling users to achieve and maintain alignment with their AI writing assistant.</draft>\n\n**Changes made:**\n- Paragraph 2: Changed opening from 'This personalization enabled by conversational context' to 'This conversational memory' - creates stronger backward reference to 'conversational context' and 'memory' from paragraph 1, making the connection more explicit and direct\n- Paragraph 3: Enhanced topic sentence to be more self-contained by stating 'addresses this lack of explicit preference representation through editable rubrics' - makes the paragraph's main claim clearer without requiring body text\n- Paragraph 3: Changed 'This creates' to 'This bidirectional process creates' - adds explicit backward reference to the just-mentioned bidirectional refinement\n- Paragraph 4: Completely restructured opening to create a substantive, self-contained topic sentence: 'This externalization of preferences through rubrics requires mechanisms...' - directly references prior paragraph's concept and states complete claim about what the paragraph will discuss\n- Paragraph 4: Transformed 'Users need the freedom to explore' into 'RubricLLM's branching workflow addresses the exploration need by...' - creates explicit backward connection to the mechanisms mentioned in topic sentence\n- Paragraph 4: Changed 'The process of translating' to 'The translation of desired changes into structured rubric modifications requires negotiation' - makes the connection to the second mechanism (negotiation) more explicit\n- Paragraph 4: Changed 'Finally, users must verify' to 'The verification of rubric specifications against actual model behavior occurs through...' - creates parallel structure with other mechanism descriptions and backward reference\n- Paragraph 4: Restructured final sentence to emphasize 'These three mechanisms—branching for exploration, AI-assisted refinement for negotiation, and criterion-level assessment for verification—work together' - creates explicit enumeration and backward reference that shows how all mentioned elements connect\n- Throughout: Ensured every major concept introduction includes explicit naming of the prior concept it builds upon, aligning with the increased importance (0.7) of backward connections in the updated Logical Flow criterion\n- Throughout: Made topic sentences more substantive and self-contained to meet the new standalone Topic Sentence Completeness criterion, ensuring each states a complete claim rather than serving as mere transition\n",

Users collaborate with these models iteratively through chat interfaces, refining drafts through multiple exchanges until the output meets their goals. The conversational context enables personalized interaction where the model maintains memory of prior exchanges.\n\nThis conversational memory creates an opacity problem: users cannot inspect what context guides the model's suggestions or verify whether learned preferences match their intent. Existing alignment approaches attempt to address this opacity through latent preference learning from user edits, treating each modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those of Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing corrections, they offer no mechanism for users to validate inferred preferences or negotiate when the model's interpretation diverges from intent. The absence of explicit preference representation in subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on stylistic preferences, audience considerations, and contextual goals rather than objective correctness—prevents users from verifying model behavior against their actual goals.\n\nWe present RubricLLM, an interactive system that addresses this lack of explicit preference representation through editable rubrics. A rubric in RubricLLM consists of structured evaluation criteria—dimensions with weighted importance, achievement level descriptors, and qualitative descriptions—that serve as a shared specification between user and AI assistant. By externalizing preferences into this explicit, structured form, RubricLLM enables users to articulate their goals and constraints for a writing task in a format that both parties can reference and modify.\n\nRubricLLM uses rubrics to guide both generation and evaluation of draft content.

When users modify a draft, they can request rubric updates that capture the preferences reflected in their edits. Conversely, when users modify the rubric—either directly or through an AI-assisted refinement interface where they describe desired changes in natural language—the system offers to regenerate the draft to align with the updated specifications. To support exploration without risk of losing prior calibrations, RubricLLM provides a branching workflow that allows users to explore alternative rubric configurations temporarily. Users can experiment with modifications, observe their effects on draft generation and evaluation, and choose to merge successful explorations or discard unsuccessful ones, preventing refinement from becoming trapped in undesired directions.
