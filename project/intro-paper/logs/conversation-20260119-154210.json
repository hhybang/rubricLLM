Existing approaches to alignment in collaborative writing focus on learning latent preferences from user edits, treating each direct modification as implicit feedback. While methods like those proposed by Gao et al. can adapt model behavior by observing user corrections, they lack mechanisms for users to inspect, validate, or refine the model's interpretation of their preferences.

        "evaluation_text": "### Academic Register Consistency\n**Weight**: 25%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 18.75\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Successfully eliminated most low-value modifiers: \"widely adopted\" → \"adopted\", \"fundamental opacity problem\" → \"opacity in their guiding criteria\", \"concrete failures\" → \"failures\", \"novel paradigm\" → \"paradigm\"\n- Replaced metaphorical language with literal descriptions: \"calibrations vanish\" → \"calibrations...do not persist\"\n- Removed subjective framing: \"poses a challenge\" → \"affects\"\n- However, retained one metaphor: \"transparency gap\" (paragraph 2 opening)\n- Maintained neutral tone throughout with objective technical language\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient rather than Exemplary due to the single retained metaphor \"transparency gap\" in paragraph 2. The rubric's Exemplary descriptor specifies \"All metaphors replaced with literal descriptions (e.g., 'transparency gap' → 'lack of transparency').\" This is explicitly listed as a required change. The draft successfully eliminates all other instances of low-value modifiers, metaphorical language, and subjective framing, meeting the Proficient standard of \"no more than one low-value modifier per paragraph; metaphors limited to conventional technical terms; predominantly neutral tone.\"\n\n**To reach next level**:\nReplace \"This transparency gap\" with \"This lack of transparency\" in the opening of paragraph 2. This is the only remaining instance of metaphorical phrasing that prevents achievement of the Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 opens with \"This lack of transparency\" explicitly referencing para 1's \"opacity\" problem using parallel terminology\n- Para 3 opens with \"makes preferences explicit\" directly contrasting para 2's \"implicit feedback\" and referencing the transparency problem\n- Solution elements directly map to stated problems using consistent terms:\n  - Problem: \"cannot inspect what criteria guide\" → Solution: \"surfacing implicit preferences\"\n  - Problem: \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions\" → Solution: \"memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\"\n  - Problem: \"cannot...adjust those criteria\" → Solution: \"control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters)\"\n- Every major claim includes backward-looking connective language\n- Reader can predict paragraph content from opening sentences\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking connections. The topic sentences use precise terminology that references prior arguments (\"This lack of transparency\", \"makes preferences explicit\"). The solution paragraph demonstrates 100% mapping between problem dimensions and solution elements using parallel terminology. The logical progression is transparent and requires no reader inference.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Precision and Conciseness Balance\n**Weight**: 30%\n**Achievement Level**: Developing (50%)\n**Weighted Score**: 15\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- **Repetitive formulations identified**:\n  - Para 1: \"users cannot inspect what criteria guide the model's suggestions or adjust those criteria\" → \"users cannot predict or control model behavior\" (control/adjust are restated)\n  - Para 3: \"(surfacing implicit preferences)\" immediately follows \"makes preferences explicit\" (same concept, different words)\n  - Para 3: \"shared specification of their writing task\" is elaborated with three parenthetical restatements: \"(surfacing implicit preferences), control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters), and memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\" - these functions are elaborative examples that restate the core concept of \"shared specification\"\n  \n- **Lack of clarifying specifications where needed**:\n  - \"adapt through conversational interaction\" (para 1) - what kind of adaptation? Style? Content? Tone?\n  - \"observing corrections\" (para 2) - what kinds of corrections? All edits, or specific types?\n  \n- **Sentence efficiency issues**:\n  - Para 3, final sentence restates the bidirectional concept already established: \"This creates an iterative alignment loop where both parties converge on shared understanding\" adds minimal new information beyond \"bidirectional negotiation\" already stated\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft shows Developing rather than Proficient because it contains multiple instances of concepts restated with minor word changes throughout. The rubric's Developing descriptor specifies \"Multiple instances of concepts restated with minor word changes; occasionally sacrifices precision for brevity; some sentences primarily repackage prior sentences.\" This accurately describes the draft. Paragraph 3 is particularly repetitive, with \"shared specification\" explained multiple times through elaborative examples that don't add meaningful precision. The draft would need to eliminate these redundancies to reach Proficient.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n1. Remove or consolidate redundant formulations: eliminate \"predict or control\" (redundant with \"adjust criteria\"), consolidate the three parenthetical functions in para 3\n2. Cut the final sentence of para 3 or revise to introduce genuinely new information\n3. Add clarifying specifications where they prevent ambiguity (e.g., specify what kind of adaptation in para 1)\n\n---\n\n### Problem-Solution Alignment\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- **Problem dimensions in para 1**:\n  1. \"cannot inspect what criteria guide the model's suggestions\"\n  2. \"cannot...adjust those criteria to match their goals\"\n  3. \"cannot predict or control model behavior during collaboration\"\n  4. \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions or documents\"\n\n- **Solution elements in para 3 with parallel terminology**:\n  1. \"communication tool (surfacing implicit preferences)\" → addresses inability to inspect criteria\n  2. \"control mechanism (providing adjustable parameters)\" → addresses inability to adjust criteria\n  3. \"bidirectional negotiation: draft edits can trigger rubric refinement suggestions, while rubric modifications steer subsequent generations\" → addresses inability to predict/control\n  4. \"memory structure (enabling cross-session reuse)\" → addresses calibrations not persisting\n\n- **Additional problem from para 2**:\n  - \"no mechanism for users to validate the model's interpretation of their preferences or negotiate\" → addressed by \"bidirectional negotiation\" and \"converge on shared understanding\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every problem dimension has a corresponding solution element using consistent terminology. The mapping is transparent and requires no inference. The solution paragraph explicitly names concepts (\"control mechanism\", \"memory structure\", \"cross-session reuse\") that directly parallel problem statements (\"adjust criteria\", \"calibrations...do not persist across sessions\"). The 1:1 mapping meets the Exemplary descriptor: \"Every problem dimension mentioned in problem statement has corresponding solution element in solution paragraph using same terminology.\"\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.",

They've now asked for a formal assessment of how well the current draft aligns with their rubric. Review the conversation history to understand:\n- The original writing goal and any constraints mentioned\n- How the draft evolved through our discussion\n- What the user explicitly valued or requested\n\nThen assess the **final draft** (the most recent assistant message) against each criterion in the rubric.\n\n## Scoring System\n\nEach criterion uses a four-level achievement scale:\n- **Exemplary (100%)**: Fully realizes the user's vision for this criterion; they'd approve with minimal or no changes\n- **Proficient (75%)**: Meets the core requirements; would satisfy user with minor polish\n- **Developing (50%)**: Shows awareness of user's goals but needs significant revision to meet their standards\n- **Beginning (25%)**: Misses or contradicts what the user values for this criterion\n\n**Overall Score Calculation:**\n1. Assign each criterion a level (25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%)\n2. Multiply by that criterion's weight\n3. Sum all weighted scores for the overall score out of 100\n\n## Evaluation Process\n\nFor each criterion in the rubric:\n\n1. **Read the criterion carefully**: Understand what THIS specific user values (not generic writing quality)\n\n2. **Review the achievement level descriptors**: Each criterion has four levels with specific, observable features. Note what distinguishes each level.\n\n3. **Examine the draft**: Look for evidence of the features described in each level. Consider:\n   - Direct quotes that exemplify or violate the criterion\n   - Structural patterns (organization, flow, balance)\n   - Tone, style, and rhetorical choices\n   - What's present AND what's missing\n\n4. **Choose the best-matching level**: Select the level whose descriptors most accurately describe what you observe in the draft. When between two levels:\n   - **Beginning vs. Developing**: Does it show awareness of the user's goal?\n   - **Developing vs. Proficient**: Would the user need substantial rework, or just polish?\n   - **Proficient vs. Exemplary**: Does it fully realize their vision, or just meet requirements?\n\n5. **Document your reasoning**: Provide specific evidence and explain why this level fits better than adjacent levels.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\nWrap your detailed evaluation in `<evaluation>` tags, following this structure for EACH criterion:\n\n### [Criterion Name from Rubric]\n**Weight**: [X%]\n**Achievement Level**: [Level Name] ([percentage]%)\n**Weighted Score**: [percentage × weight / 100]\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- [Specific quote, example, or observation from the draft]\n- [Another piece of concrete evidence]\n- [Continue with all relevant evidence]\n\n**Rationale**:\n[Explain why you chose this level over adjacent levels. Reference the specific descriptors from the rubric's achievement levels. Be concrete about what features you observed or what was missing.]\n\n**To reach next level**:\n[If not Exemplary: Describe the specific, actionable changes needed to reach the next achievement level. Reference what the next level's descriptors require that the current draft lacks.]\n\n---\n\n[Repeat the above structure for EVERY criterion in the rubric]\n\n## After All Criteria\n\nAfter completing the evaluation for all criteria, provide a JSON summary:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overall_score\": <sum of all weighted scores, out of 100>,\n  \"score_interpretation\": \"<Exceptional (90+) | Strong (80-89) | Solid (70-79) | Developing (50-69) | Emerging (<50)>\",\n  \"criteria_scores\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"<exact criterion name from rubric>\",\n      \"weight\": <weight as integer>,\n      \"achievement_level\": \"<Exemplary|Proficient|Developing|Beginning>\",\n      \"level_percentage\": <25|50|75|100>,\n      \"weighted_score\": <level_percentage × weight / 100>,\n      \"evidence_summary\": \"<1-2 sentence summary of key evidence>\"\n    }\n    // Include ALL criteria\n  ],\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"<2-3 sentences: Does this draft align with the user's demonstrated values?

RubricLLM's branching workflow addresses this by preserving prior states, allowing users to revert when a modification steers the model in an undesired direction. The process of translating desired changes into structured rubric modifications requires negotiation between user and model to ensure shared understanding. An AI-assisted rubric refinement interface supports this negotiation by enabling users to describe changes in natural language, observe the model's interpretation through proposed modifications, and preview effects in updated drafts before committing changes. Finally, users must verify that their rubric specifications produce the intended model behavior. Draft assessment against the active rubric provides criterion-level scoring that makes this verification possible, establishing accountability between specified preferences and generated output.

When a draft exists, users can evaluate it against the active rubric to assess alignment with their stated criteria.

RubricLLM infers rubrics from conversation history, analyzing exchanges and draft iterations to extract implicit preferences into explicit criteria. The system uses rubrics to guide both generation and evaluation: during generation, the active rubric conditions model suggestions toward specified preferences, while evaluation against the rubric provides criterion-level scoring that reveals how the model interprets each dimension in the context of the current draft.\n\nTo enable iterative alignment, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement between drafts and rubrics. When users modify a draft, they can request rubric updates that capture preferences reflected in their edits. When users modify the rubric—either directly or through an AI-assisted refinement interface—the system regenerates the draft to align with updated specifications. A branching workflow allows users to explore alternative rubric configurations temporarily: users experiment with modifications, observe effects on generation and evaluation, and merge successful explorations or discard unsuccessful ones. These mechanisms—inference from conversation history, bidirectional refinement, and branched exploration—enable users to achieve transparency and control in AI-assisted writing.\n</draft>\n\n**Key changes for ICML tone:**\n\n1. **Removed conversational phrases**:\n   - \"feel more personalized\" → removed (too subjective)\n   - \"preventing refinement from becoming trapped in undesired directions\" → removed (metaphorical)\n   - \"By combining...with mechanisms for...\" → simplified to direct statement\n\n2. **Tightened technical language**:\n   - \"an interactive system\" → \"a system\" (unnecessary modifier)\n   - \"steers model suggestions\" → \"conditions model suggestions\" (more technical)\n   - \"offers to regenerate\" → \"regenerates\" (more direct)\n\n3. **Made structures parallel**:\n   - Final paragraph now has consistent structure: \"When users X, they can Y. When users Z, the system does W.\"\n   - List of mechanisms at end is more concise\n\n4. **Removed redundancy**:\n   - Cut \"serve as a shared specification between user and AI assistant\" repetition\n   - Condensed branching description\n   - Removed \"choose to\" (implied by \"merge or discard\")\n\nDoes this feel more appropriate for ICML? Any specific sections still feel off?",

      "content": "<draft>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as writing assistants for tasks such as drafting emails, research papers, creative content, and professional documents. These systems typically operate through conversational interfaces, where users iteratively refine drafts across multiple turns. Over time, the model conditions its responses on the accumulated conversational context, creating the appearance of personalized assistance as it adapts to a user's feedback and revisions.\n\nWhile this adaptation creates the appearance of personalization, the underlying mechanism remains opaque to users. Users cannot inspect what preferences the model has inferred from their interactions, nor can they verify whether those inferred preferences accurately reflect their intent. For subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on nuanced considerations of style, tone, audience, and rhetorical goals rather than objective correctness—this opacity becomes particularly problematic. Users must rely on trial-and-error to steer model behavior, repeatedly revising outputs until they match unstated criteria, with no principled way to communicate or verify their standards. Existing alignment approaches address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly from user edits and corrections. Methods such as those proposed by Gao et al. demonstrate that models can adapt their behavior by treating revisions as preference signals, gradually aligning outputs with user intent. However, these approaches provide no mechanism for users to inspect the learned preferences, validate that the model's interpretation matches their actual intent, or negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals. This lack of explicit preference representation prevents users from achieving transparent, controllable alignment in collaborative writing.\n\nWe introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit writing preferences explicit by representing them as structured rubrics. A rubric encodes evaluative criteria as named dimensions with weighted importance and concrete achievement descriptors, serving as a shared specification between the user and the model. RubricLLM infers these rubrics by analyzing conversational context and draft revisions, translating patterns in user feedback into an explicit, inspectable representation of preferences. Once inferred, the rubric plays a dual role: it conditions generation to reflect the specified criteria, and it supports criterion-level evaluation of drafts, revealing how the model interprets each dimension. This evaluative feedback enables users to directly observe whether the inferred rubric—and the behavior it induces—aligns with their intended goals.\n\nBecause inferred preferences may be incomplete, inaccurate, or evolve over the course of a task, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement between drafts and rubrics. Users can update the rubric in response to model behavior, or request rubric revisions that reflect the intent behind their edits to a draft. The system then regenerates content consistent with the revised specification. To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow that allows users to temporarily modify rubrics, observe their effects on generation and evaluation, and selectively merge or discard changes. By combining explicit preference representations with iterative, user-driven refinement, RubricLLM enables transparent and controllable alignment in AI-assisted writing.\n</draft>\n\n**Key changes to paragraph 2:**\n\n1. **Opening contrast**: \"While this adaptation creates the appearance of personalization, the underlying mechanism remains opaque\" - directly contrasts para 1's \"appearance of personalized assistance\"\n\n2. **Problem → subjective tasks flow**: \n   - First establishes the opacity problem (cannot inspect/verify)\n   - Then explains why it matters for subjective tasks specifically\n   - Includes concrete description of the trial-and-error consequence\n\n3. **Emphasizes what Gao does well**: \"Methods such as those proposed by Gao et al. demonstrate that models can adapt their behavior by treating revisions as preference signals, gradually aligning outputs with user intent\" - acknowledges their contribution before critique\n\n4. **Clear critique**: \"However, these approaches provide no mechanism for...\" - explains what's missing\n\n5. **Setup for solution**: Ends with \"This lack of explicit preference representation prevents users from achieving transparent, controllable alignment\" - directly sets up para 3's \"makes implicit writing preferences explicit\"\n\nDoes this flow work better?",

For subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on nuanced considerations of style, tone, audience, and rhetorical goals rather than objective correctness—this opacity becomes particularly problematic. Users must rely on trial-and-error to steer model behavior, repeatedly revising outputs until they match unstated criteria, with no principled way to communicate or verify their standards. \n\nExisting alignment approaches address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly from user edits and corrections. Methods such as those proposed by Gao et al. demonstrate that models can adapt their behavior by treating revisions as preference signals, gradually aligning outputs with user intent.

Users can update the rubric in response to model behavior, or request rubric revisions that reflect the intent behind their edits to a draft.

Over time, the model conditions its responses on the accumulated conversational context, creating the appearance of personalized assistance as it adapts to a user's feedback and revisions.\n\nThis context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent. For subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on nuanced considerations of style, tone, audience, and rhetorical goals rather than objective correctness—this opacity becomes particularly problematic. Users must rely on trial-and-error to steer model behavior, repeatedly revising outputs until they match unstated criteria, with no principled way to communicate or verify their standards. \n\nExisting alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly from user edits and corrections, gradually aligning outputs with user intent. However, these approaches provide no mechanism for users to validate that the model's interpretation of the learned preferences matches their actual intent or negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals. This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences prevents them from achieving alignment in subjective writing tasks, where quality depends on criteria that must be made explicit and jointly refined.\n\nTo make implicit writing preferences explicit, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that represents them as structured rubrics.

RubricLLM infers these rubrics by analyzing conversational context and draft revisions, translating patterns in user feedback into an explicit, inspectable representation of preferences. Once inferred, the rubric plays a dual role: it conditions generation to reflect the specified criteria, and it supports criterion-level evaluation of drafts, revealing how the model interprets each dimension.

These systems typically operate through conversational interfaces, where users iteratively refine drafts across multiple turns. Over time, the model conditions its responses on the accumulated conversational context, creating the appearance of personalized assistance as it adapts to a user's feedback and revisions.\n\nThis context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent. For subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on nuanced considerations of style, tone, audience, and rhetorical goals rather than objective correctness—this opacity becomes particularly problematic. Users must rely on trial-and-error to steer model behavior, repeatedly revising outputs until they match unstated criteria, with no principled way to communicate or verify their standards. \n\nExisting alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly from user edits and corrections, gradually aligning outputs with user intent. However, these approaches provide no mechanism for users to validate that the model's interpretation of the learned preferences matches their actual intent or negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals. This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences prevents them from achieving alignment in subjective writing tasks, where quality depends on criteria that must be made explicit and jointly refined.\n\nTo address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable by representing them as structured rubrics. A rubric consists of named evaluation dimensions—each with weighted importance and concrete achievement descriptors—that serve as an explicit, shared specification between user and model. RubricLLM infers these rubrics by analyzing conversational context and draft revisions, translating patterns in user feedback into a structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque. This externalization enables inspection: users can examine the specific criteria that guide model behavior rather than inferring preferences from observed outputs alone. Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role in generation and evaluation. During generation, the rubric conditions model suggestions to reflect the specified criteria.

        "evaluation_text": "### Academic Register Consistency\n**Weight**: 22%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 16.5\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- \"concrete achievement descriptors\" - \"concrete\" is flagged in the rubric as an unnecessary modifier\n- \"particularly problematic\" - \"particularly\" adds emphasis without semantic content; \"problematic\" has slight subjective framing\n- \"nuanced considerations\" - \"nuanced\" is a low-value modifier\n- \"gradually aligning\" - \"gradually\" adds limited semantic value\n- \"black box\" - metaphorical but conventional technical term in ML/AI, acceptable\n- Good technical precision: \"structured representation\", \"explicit, shared specification\", \"bidirectional refinement\"\n- Strong active voice throughout: \"RubricLLM infers...\", \"the system scores...\", \"Users can update...\"\n- \"creating the appearance of personalized assistance\" - good literal description rather than claiming actual personalization\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient because it maintains predominantly neutral, technical language with only a few instances of low-value modifiers per paragraph. The rubric's Exemplary descriptor requires \"zero instances of modifiers that add emphasis without semantic content\" and specifically flags \"concrete\" as an example. The draft uses \"concrete achievement descriptors\" and several other modifiers (\"particularly\", \"nuanced\", \"gradually\") that add emphasis without precision. However, the draft successfully avoids extended metaphors, uses appropriate formal conventions (\"We introduce...\"), and maintains active voice with clear agents throughout.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Replace \"concrete achievement descriptors\" with \"achievement descriptors\"\n- Change \"particularly problematic\" to \"problematic\" or rephrase to specify what makes it more problematic\n- Remove \"nuanced\" from \"nuanced considerations\" or replace with specific examples\n- Remove \"gradually\" from \"gradually aligning\"\n\n---\n\n### Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 4 opening: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM\" - infinitive construction stating purpose before mechanism\n- Para 4: \"This externalization enables inspection: users can examine...\" - purpose (inspection) stated before describing what users can do\n- Para 4: \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role\" - purpose stated before describing the role\n- Para 5 opening: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved\" - causal reasoning explaining WHY refinement is needed\n- Para 5: \"To address these misalignments, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement\" - purpose before mechanism\n- Para 5: \"To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow\" - purpose before mechanism\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because it consistently uses both infinitive constructions (\"To address...\", \"To support...\") and causal/conditional framing (\"The validation...may reveal...\") before describing mechanisms. Every major feature introduction includes explicit purpose or reasoning statements. The topic sentence of paragraph 4 exemplifies the pattern: purpose first (\"To address the opacity of preference learning\"), then mechanism (\"we introduce RubricLLM, a system that...\"). Paragraph 5's opening provides causal reasoning (\"may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete\") that motivates the bidirectional refinement mechanism that follows.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 28%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 28\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 → Para 1: \"This context-driven adaptation\" explicitly references para 1's discussion of adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 3 → Para 2: \"address this challenge\" explicitly references the opacity challenge from para 2\n- Para 3 ending: \"This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences\" - backward reference to the just-described limitation\n- Para 4 → Para 3: \"To address the opacity of preference learning\" references both para 2's \"black box\" and para 3's \"implicit\" learning\n- Within Para 4: \"This externalization enables inspection\" references the externalization just described\n- Within Para 4: \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation\" creates explicit progression\n- Para 5 → Para 4: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation\" directly references para 4's evaluation mechanism\n- Within Para 5: \"To address these misalignments\" references the misalignments just described\n\n**Problem-Solution terminology mapping**:\n- \"cannot inspect\" → \"inspectable\", \"enables inspection\"\n- \"verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent\" → \"validate whether the rubric...aligns with their actual goals\"\n- \"negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge\" → \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\"\n- \"must be made explicit\" → \"explicit, shared specification\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking references using consistent terminology. The solution elements in paragraphs 4-5 directly map to problem dimensions in paragraphs 2-3 using parallel language (\"inspect/inspectable\", \"validate/validation\", \"negotiate/negotiation\", \"explicit\"). The reader can trace the logical progression without inference—each concept introduction explicitly names the prior concept it builds upon.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Topic Sentence Completeness\n**Weight**: 7%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 5.25\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 1: \"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as writing assistants...\" - introduces topic but doesn't capture the paragraph's main argument about adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 2: \"This context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent.\" - **Excellent**: fully encapsulates the paragraph's claim\n- Para 3: \"Existing alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly...\" - introduces what approaches do, but the paragraph's main point is their *limitation*; the topic sentence doesn't capture the critique\n- Para 4: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable by representing them as structured rubrics.\" - **Excellent**: fully captures the contribution\n- Para 5: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved over the course of the writing task.\" - sets up the problem but the paragraph's main claim is about bidirectional refinement as the solution\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient because most paragraphs have strong topic sentences, but paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 require reading the body to understand the main point. Paragraphs 2 and 4 are exemplary—a reader can understand the core argument from the opening sentence alone. Paragraph 3's topic sentence presents existing approaches positively before critiquing them, so the actual claim (that they fail) isn't apparent until mid-paragraph.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Para 1: Revise to include the key point about adaptation appearing personalized\n- Para 3: Revise to lead with the limitation, e.g., \"Existing alignment approaches lack mechanisms for validation and negotiation of preferences. Methods such as Gao et al. learn preferences implicitly from user edits...\"\n- Para 5: Revise to foreground bidirectional refinement, e.g., \"To address misalignments that validation may reveal, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement between drafts and rubrics.\"\n\n---\n\n### Precision and Interpretive Synthesis\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 15\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n**Interpretive synthesis present**:\n- \"creating the appearance of personalized assistance as it adapts\" - explains what context memory MEANS for users\n- \"This externalization enables inspection: users can examine the specific criteria that guide model behavior rather than inferring preferences from observed outputs alone\" - explains significance\n- \"This evaluative feedback allows users to validate whether the rubric—and the behavior it induces—aligns with their actual goals, establishing the foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\" - explains what evaluation ENABLES\n\n**Solution completeness**:\n- Rubric structure described (dimensions, weights, achievement descriptors)\n- Dual role explained (generation + evaluation)\n- Both directions of bidirectional refinement specified\n- Branching workflow explained\n\n**Potential redundancy**:\n- Para 2-3 both discuss validation/verification, but para 2 establishes the problem and para 3 positions existing work—appropriate distinction\n\n**Missing interpretive synthesis**:\n- \"RubricLLM infers these rubrics by analyzing conversational context and draft revisions\" - describes WHAT but not WHAT THIS MEANS for users\n- Branching workflow description doesn't include interpretive statement about what this enables beyond \"exploration without commitment\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient because it includes interpretive synthesis for most major features and problems, but not consistently for every mechanism. The draft explains what externalization, evaluation, and validation mean for users, but some mechanism descriptions (rubric inference, branching) focus on WHAT without fully articulating WHAT IT MEANS. Problem sections are efficient without redundancy, and solution sections provide comprehensive specification.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Add interpretive synthesis to rubric inference: e.g., \"translating patterns in user feedback into a structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque. This inference mechanism means users need not manually specify criteria from scratch—the system bootstraps the rubric from their existing feedback.\"\n- Add interpretive synthesis to branching: e.g., after \"selectively merge or discard changes\" add \"This separation of exploration from commitment enables users to experiment with alternative preference configurations without risking the loss of calibrations they value.\"\n\n---\n\n### Problem-Solution Alignment\n**Weight**: 3%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 3\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n**Problem dimensions (Para 2-3)**:\n1. \"cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes\"\n2. \"verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent\"\n3. \"negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals\"\n4. \"criteria that must be made explicit\"\n5. \"jointly refined\"\n\n**Solution elements (Para 4-5) with parallel terminology**:\n1. \"makes implicit preferences...inspectable\" / \"enables inspection\"\n2. \"allows users to validate whether the rubric...aligns with their actual goals\"\n3. \"negotiable\" / \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\"\n4. \"explicit, shared specification\" / \"explicit preference representations\"\n5. \"iterative, user-driven refinement\" / \"jointly refined\" (echoed in final sentence)\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every problem dimension mentioned in paragraphs 2-3 has a corresponding solution element in paragraphs 4-5 using the same or parallel terminology. The mapping is transparent: \"inspect/inspectable\", \"validate/validation\", \"negotiate/negotiation\", \"explicit/explicit\", \"jointly refined/user-driven refinement\". A reader can trace each problem to its solution without inference.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---",

Academic Register Consistency (weight 22.0)\n2. Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization (weight 20.0)\n3. Logical Flow and Explicit Connections (weight 28.0)\n4. Topic Sentence Completeness (weight 7.0)\n5. Precision and Interpretive Synthesis (weight 20.0)\n6. Problem-Solution Alignment (weight 3.0)\n\nLet me evaluate each one carefully.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Register Consistency (22%)\n\nLooking for:\n- Modifiers without semantic content (widely, fundamental, concrete, novel)\n- Metaphorical vs literal phrasing\n- Technical precision\n- Subjective/emotional framing\n- Active voice with clear agents\n\nEvidence from draft:\n- \"increasingly used\" - \"increasingly\" adds some emphasis but is factual\n- \"black box\" - this is metaphorical but is a conventional technical term in ML/AI\n- \"particularly problematic\" - \"particularly\" is a modifier, \"problematic\" is slightly subjective framing\n- \"nuanced considerations\" - \"nuanced\" is a modifier that adds limited semantic value\n- \"trial-and-error\" - conventional technical term\n- \"principled way\" - \"principled\" adds some emphasis\n- \"gradually aligning\" - \"gradually\" adds limited value\n- \"explicit, shared specification\" - appropriate technical language\n- \"structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque\" - good technical language\n- \"concrete achievement descriptors\" - \"concrete\" is flagged in the rubric as an unnecessary modifier\n- \"transparent and controllable alignment\" - \"transparent\" and \"controllable\" are technical terms here, not empty modifiers\n\nMetaphors:\n- \"black box\" - conventional technical metaphor, acceptable\n- \"foundation for negotiation\" - slight metaphor but acceptable\n\n\n- \"creating the appearance of personalized assistance\" - this phrasing effectively distinguishes appearance from reality without unnecessary embellishment\n\nVoice:\n- Generally uses active voice with clear agents: \"RubricLLM infers...\", \"the system scores...\", \"Users can update...\"\n- Some passive: \"are increasingly used\" in opening\n\nSeveral weak points stand out: \"concrete achievement descriptors\" relies on a flagged modifier, \"particularly problematic\" leans subjective, and \"nuanced considerations\" and \"gradually aligning\" contribute minimal semantic value. This lands at Proficient (75%) - the core requirements are met, but these modifiers and slight subjective framings prevent a higher score.\n\nPurpose-Before-Mechanism Organization shows strong execution. The draft consistently states goals before describing how they work: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM\" establishes intent first, then mechanism. The pattern repeats with \"This externalization enables inspection: users can examine...\" and \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role.\" Later, when validation reveals incomplete preferences, the response is framed as \"To address these misalignments, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement\" - again, purpose precedes the technical description.\n\nThe branching workflow section follows the same structure with \"To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow.\" While some passages like \"During generation, the rubric conditions model suggestions...During evaluation, the system scores drafts...\" present mechanism first, these appear after the overarching purpose has already been established. The consistent use of \"To address...\" and \"To support...\" constructions throughout demonstrates exemplary adherence to this principle.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Logical Flow and Explicit Connections (28%)\n\nLooking for:\n- Explicit backward references to prior arguments\n- Clear signaling of logical relationships\n- Solution elements mapping\n\nThe draft builds connections systematically across sections. Para 2 explicitly references para 1's adaptation mechanism as a \"black box,\" then para 3 identifies the resulting challenge and notes that existing approaches don't fully address it. Para 4 directly references para 2's opacity concern while introducing rubrics as a solution, with phrases like \"This externalization enables inspection\" and \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation\" creating clear logical progression. Para 5 continues this chain by referencing the validation mechanisms from para 4 and how they might reveal misalignments, then uses \"To address these misalignments\" to signal the next development. Each section explicitly connects back to prior arguments rather than introducing ideas in isolation.\n\nThe problem-solution structure reinforces this coherence: the inability to inspect preferences gets solved through externalization, the verification problem gets addressed through rubric validation, and the negotiation gap gets bridged through establishing foundations for dialogue. Every major problem statement has a corresponding solution presented later, making the argument feel complete and purposeful. This represents exemplary backward referencing throughout.\n\nPara 1 sets the scene with LLM usage in writing tasks but doesn't actually articulate the paper's core argument about conversational adaptation and its hidden mechanisms. Para 2 does this much better—it directly states the central tension between observable behavior changes and invisible preference drivers. Para 3 mentions existing alignment methods learn preferences implicitly, yet misses the crucial point that these approaches fundamentally fail at making preferences transparent. Para 4 begins introducing the proposed system to tackle this opacity problem.\n\nThe system makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable through structured rubrics. Para 5 identifies a key limitation—that inferred preferences may be incomplete or outdated—but frames this as a problem rather than emphasizing the bidirectional refinement process that actually solves it. Overall, the summaries capture the technical contributions in paragraphs 2 and 4, but the framing in 1, 3, and 5 misses the argumentative thrust, suggesting room for improvement in how I'm synthesizing the paper's logic.\n\nLooking at precision and interpretive synthesis, I need to examine whether the summaries explain why these contributions matter and what their implications are for the broader problem of preference alignment.\n\nThe strongest examples show interpretive depth: explaining that context memory creates an illusion of personalization, that externalization enables inspection rather than inference, and that evaluative feedback establishes grounds for negotiation when interpretations diverge. These go beyond describing what happens to explaining what it means.\n\nThe solution descriptions are fairly comprehensive—rubric structure with dimensions and weights, the dual role in generation and evaluation, bidirectional refinement in both directions, and the branching workflow. However, there's some redundancy between paragraphs 2 and 3 around opacity and validation that could be tightened. The problem sections could also be more concise to make room for deeper interpretive synthesis about why these mechanisms matter for the core challenge of making preferences negotiable.\n\nFor problem-solution alignment, the draft maps well: the inability to inspect preferences connects to \"makes implicit preferences inspectable,\" the inability to verify interpretation aligns with \"allows users to validate whether the rubric matches their actual goals,\" and the inability to negotiate connects to \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge.\" The terminology tracks across problem and solution sections fairly consistently, though some terms like \"validate\" and \"negotiate\" appear in multiple contexts that could be clarified.\n\nNow calculating the overall score: Academic Register Consistency contributes 16.5 points (75% of 22), Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization adds the full 20 points, Logical Flow provides 28 points, Topic Sentence Completeness adds 5.25 points, and Precision and Interpretive Synthesis contributes 15 points.\n\nThe Problem-Solution Alignment scores perfectly at 3 points, bringing the total to 87.75—a strong performance in the 80-89 range."

Note what distinguishes each level.\n\n3. **Examine the draft**: Look for evidence of the features described in each level. Consider:\n   - Direct quotes that exemplify or violate the criterion\n   - Structural patterns (organization, flow, balance)\n   - Tone, style, and rhetorical choices\n   - What's present AND what's missing\n\n4. **Choose the best-matching level**: Select the level whose descriptors most accurately describe what you observe in the draft. When between two levels:\n   - **Beginning vs. Developing**: Does it show awareness of the user's goal?\n   - **Developing vs. Proficient**: Would the user need substantial rework, or just polish?\n   - **Proficient vs. Exemplary**: Does it fully realize their vision, or just meet requirements?\n\n5. **Document your reasoning**: Provide specific evidence and explain why this level fits better than adjacent levels.\n\n## Required Output Format\n\nWrap your detailed evaluation in `<evaluation>` tags, following this structure for EACH criterion:\n\n### [Criterion Name from Rubric]\n**Weight**: [X%]\n**Achievement Level**: [Level Name] ([percentage]%)\n**Weighted Score**: [percentage × weight / 100]\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- [Specific quote, example, or observation from the draft]\n- [Another piece of concrete evidence]\n- [Continue with all relevant evidence]\n\n**Rationale**:\n[Explain why you chose this level over adjacent levels.

These systems typically operate through conversational interfaces, where users iteratively refine drafts across multiple turns. Over time, the model conditions its responses on the accumulated conversational context, creating the appearance of personalized assistance as it adapts to a user's feedback and revisions.\n\nThis context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent. For subjective writing tasks—where quality depends on nuanced considerations of style, tone, audience, and rhetorical goals rather than objective correctness—this opacity becomes particularly problematic. Users must rely on trial-and-error to steer model behavior, repeatedly revising outputs until they match unstated criteria, with no principled way to communicate or verify their standards. \n\nExisting alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly from user edits and corrections, gradually aligning outputs with user intent. However, these approaches provide no mechanism for users to validate that the model's interpretation of the learned preferences matches their actual intent or negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals. This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences prevents them from achieving alignment in subjective writing tasks, where quality depends on criteria that must be made explicit and jointly refined.\n\nTo address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable by representing them as structured rubrics. A rubric consists of named evaluation dimensions—each with weighted importance and concrete achievement descriptors—that serve as an explicit, shared specification between user and model. RubricLLM infers these rubrics by analyzing conversational context and draft revisions, translating patterns in user feedback into a structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque. This externalization enables inspection: users can examine the specific criteria that guide model behavior rather than inferring preferences from observed outputs alone. Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role in generation and evaluation. During generation, the rubric conditions model suggestions to reflect the specified criteria. During evaluation, the system scores drafts against each rubric dimension, revealing how the model interprets and applies those criteria in the context of the current draft. This evaluative feedback allows users to validate whether the rubric—and the behavior it induces—aligns with their actual goals, establishing the foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge.\n\nThe validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved over the course of the writing task. To address these misalignments, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement between drafts and rubrics. Users can update the rubric in response to model behavior, or request rubric revisions that reflect the intent behind their edits to a draft. The system then regenerates content consistent with the revised specification. To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow that allows users to temporarily modify rubrics, observe their effects on generation and evaluation, and selectively merge or discard changes. By combining explicit preference representations with iterative, user-driven refinement, RubricLLM enables transparent and controllable alignment in AI-assisted writing.\n</draft>\n",

However, the draft successfully avoids extended metaphors, uses appropriate formal conventions (\"We introduce...\"), and maintains active voice with clear agents throughout.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Replace \"concrete achievement descriptors\" with \"achievement descriptors\"\n- Change \"particularly problematic\" to \"problematic\" or rephrase to specify what makes it more problematic\n- Remove \"nuanced\" from \"nuanced considerations\" or replace with specific examples\n- Remove \"gradually\" from \"gradually aligning\"\n\n---\n\n### Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization\n**Weight**: 20%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 20\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 4 opening: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM\" - infinitive construction stating purpose before mechanism\n- Para 4: \"This externalization enables inspection: users can examine...\" - purpose (inspection) stated before describing what users can do\n- Para 4: \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role\" - purpose stated before describing the role\n- Para 5 opening: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved\" - causal reasoning explaining WHY refinement is needed\n- Para 5: \"To address these misalignments, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement\" - purpose before mechanism\n- Para 5: \"To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow\" - purpose before mechanism\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because it consistently uses both infinitive constructions (\"To address...\", \"To support...\") and causal/conditional framing (\"The validation...may reveal...\") before describing mechanisms. Every major feature introduction includes explicit purpose or reasoning statements. The topic sentence of paragraph 4 exemplifies the pattern: purpose first (\"To address the opacity of preference learning\"), then mechanism (\"we introduce RubricLLM, a system that...\"). Paragraph 5's opening provides causal reasoning (\"may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete\") that motivates the bidirectional refinement mechanism that follows.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 28%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 28\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 → Para 1: \"This context-driven adaptation\" explicitly references para 1's discussion of adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 3 → Para 2: \"address this challenge\" explicitly references the opacity challenge from para 2\n- Para 3 ending: \"This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences\" - backward reference to the just-described limitation\n- Para 4 → Para 3: \"To address the opacity of preference learning\" references both para 2's \"black box\" and para 3's \"implicit\" learning\n- Within Para 4: \"This externalization enables inspection\" references the externalization just described\n- Within Para 4: \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation\" creates explicit progression\n- Para 5 → Para 4: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation\" directly references para 4's evaluation mechanism\n- Within Para 5: \"To address these misalignments\" references the misalignments just described\n\n**Problem-Solution terminology mapping**:\n- \"cannot inspect\" → \"inspectable\", \"enables inspection\"\n- \"verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent\" → \"validate whether the rubric...aligns with their actual goals\"\n- \"negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge\" → \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\"\n- \"must be made explicit\" → \"explicit, shared specification\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking references using consistent terminology. The solution elements in paragraphs 4-5 directly map to problem dimensions in paragraphs 2-3 using parallel language (\"inspect/inspectable\", \"validate/validation\", \"negotiate/negotiation\", \"explicit\"). The reader can trace the logical progression without inference—each concept introduction explicitly names the prior concept it builds upon.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Topic Sentence Completeness\n**Weight**: 7%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 5.25\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 1: \"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as writing assistants...\" - introduces topic but doesn't capture the paragraph's main argument about adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 2: \"This context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent.\" - **Excellent**: fully encapsulates the paragraph's claim\n- Para 3: \"Existing alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly...\" - introduces what approaches do, but the paragraph's main point is their *limitation*; the topic sentence doesn't capture the critique\n- Para 4: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable by representing them as structured rubrics.\" - **Excellent**: fully captures the contribution\n- Para 5: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved over the course of the writing task.\" - sets up the problem but the paragraph's main claim is about bidirectional refinement as the solution\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient because most paragraphs have strong topic sentences, but paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 require reading the body to understand the main point. Paragraphs 2 and 4 are exemplary—a reader can understand the core argument from the opening sentence alone. Paragraph 3's topic sentence presents existing approaches positively before critiquing them, so the actual claim (that they fail) isn't apparent until mid-paragraph.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Para 1: Revise to include the key point about adaptation appearing personalized\n- Para 3: Revise to lead with the limitation, e.g., \"Existing alignment approaches lack mechanisms for validation and negotiation of preferences.

The draft explains what externalization, evaluation, and validation mean for users, but some mechanism descriptions (rubric inference, branching) focus on WHAT without fully articulating WHAT IT MEANS. Problem sections are efficient without redundancy, and solution sections provide comprehensive specification.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Add interpretive synthesis to rubric inference: e.g., \"translating patterns in user feedback into a structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque. This inference mechanism means users need not manually specify criteria from scratch—the system bootstraps the rubric from their existing feedback.\"\n- Add interpretive synthesis to branching: e.g., after \"selectively merge or discard changes\" add \"This separation of exploration from commitment enables users to experiment with alternative preference configurations without risking the loss of calibrations they value.\"\n\n---\n\n### Problem-Solution Alignment\n**Weight**: 3%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 3\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n**Problem dimensions (Para 2-3)**:\n1. \"cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes\"\n2. \"verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent\"\n3. \"negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge from their goals\"\n4. \"criteria that must be made explicit\"\n5. \"jointly refined\"\n\n**Solution elements (Para 4-5) with parallel terminology**:\n1. \"makes implicit preferences...inspectable\" / \"enables inspection\"\n2. \"allows users to validate whether the rubric...aligns with their actual goals\"\n3. \"negotiable\" / \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\"\n4. \"explicit, shared specification\" / \"explicit preference representations\"\n5. \"iterative, user-driven refinement\" / \"jointly refined\" (echoed in final sentence)\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every problem dimension mentioned in paragraphs 2-3 has a corresponding solution element in paragraphs 4-5 using the same or parallel terminology.

The topic sentence of paragraph 4 exemplifies the pattern: purpose first (\"To address the opacity of preference learning\"), then mechanism (\"we introduce RubricLLM, a system that...\"). Paragraph 5's opening provides causal reasoning (\"may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete\") that motivates the bidirectional refinement mechanism that follows.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flow and Explicit Connections\n**Weight**: 28%\n**Achievement Level**: Exemplary (100%)\n**Weighted Score**: 28\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 2 → Para 1: \"This context-driven adaptation\" explicitly references para 1's discussion of adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 3 → Para 2: \"address this challenge\" explicitly references the opacity challenge from para 2\n- Para 3 ending: \"This lack of mechanisms for users to validate and negotiate preferences\" - backward reference to the just-described limitation\n- Para 4 → Para 3: \"To address the opacity of preference learning\" references both para 2's \"black box\" and para 3's \"implicit\" learning\n- Within Para 4: \"This externalization enables inspection\" references the externalization just described\n- Within Para 4: \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation\" creates explicit progression\n- Para 5 → Para 4: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation\" directly references para 4's evaluation mechanism\n- Within Para 5: \"To address these misalignments\" references the misalignments just described\n\n**Problem-Solution terminology mapping**:\n- \"cannot inspect\" → \"inspectable\", \"enables inspection\"\n- \"verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent\" → \"validate whether the rubric...aligns with their actual goals\"\n- \"negotiate when the inferred preferences diverge\" → \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge\"\n- \"must be made explicit\" → \"explicit, shared specification\"\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Exemplary because every paragraph opens with explicit backward-looking references using consistent terminology. The solution elements in paragraphs 4-5 directly map to problem dimensions in paragraphs 2-3 using parallel language (\"inspect/inspectable\", \"validate/validation\", \"negotiate/negotiation\", \"explicit\"). The reader can trace the logical progression without inference—each concept introduction explicitly names the prior concept it builds upon.\n\n**To reach next level**:\nAlready at Exemplary level.\n\n---\n\n### Topic Sentence Completeness\n**Weight**: 7%\n**Achievement Level**: Proficient (75%)\n**Weighted Score**: 5.25\n\n**Evidence from draft**:\n- Para 1: \"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as writing assistants...\" - introduces topic but doesn't capture the paragraph's main argument about adaptation through conversational context\n- Para 2: \"This context-driven adaptation, however, operates as a black box: users observe changes in model behavior but cannot inspect what preferences drive those changes or verify whether the model's interpretation matches their intent.\" - **Excellent**: fully encapsulates the paragraph's claim\n- Para 3: \"Existing alignment approaches, such as those proposed by Gao et al., address this challenge by learning preferences implicitly...\" - introduces what approaches do, but the paragraph's main point is their *limitation*; the topic sentence doesn't capture the critique\n- Para 4: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM, a system that makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable by representing them as structured rubrics.\" - **Excellent**: fully captures the contribution\n- Para 5: \"The validation enabled by rubric-based evaluation may reveal that inferred preferences are incomplete, inaccurate, or have evolved over the course of the writing task.\" - sets up the problem but the paragraph's main claim is about bidirectional refinement as the solution\n\n**Rationale**:\nThe draft achieves Proficient because most paragraphs have strong topic sentences, but paragraphs 1, 3, and 5 require reading the body to understand the main point. Paragraphs 2 and 4 are exemplary—a reader can understand the core argument from the opening sentence alone. Paragraph 3's topic sentence presents existing approaches positively before critiquing them, so the actual claim (that they fail) isn't apparent until mid-paragraph.\n\n**To reach next level**:\n- Para 1: Revise to include the key point about adaptation appearing personalized\n- Para 3: Revise to lead with the limitation, e.g., \"Existing alignment approaches lack mechanisms for validation and negotiation of preferences.

        "thinking": "Let me carefully evaluate this draft against the rubric provided. I need to go through each criterion systematically.\n\nThe rubric has 6 criteria:\n1. Academic Register Consistency (weight 22.0)\n2. Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization (weight 20.0)\n3. Logical Flow and Explicit Connections (weight 28.0)\n4. Topic Sentence Completeness (weight 7.0)\n5. Precision and Interpretive Synthesis (weight 20.0)\n6. Problem-Solution Alignment (weight 3.0)\n\nLet me evaluate each one carefully.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Academic Register Consistency (22%)\n\nLooking for:\n- Modifiers without semantic content (widely, fundamental, concrete, novel)\n- Metaphorical vs literal phrasing\n- Technical precision\n- Subjective/emotional framing\n- Active voice with clear agents\n\nEvidence from draft:\n- \"increasingly used\" - \"increasingly\" adds some emphasis but is factual\n- \"black box\" - this is metaphorical but is a conventional technical term in ML/AI\n- \"particularly problematic\" - \"particularly\" is a modifier, \"problematic\" is slightly subjective framing\n- \"nuanced considerations\" - \"nuanced\" is a modifier that adds limited semantic value\n- \"trial-and-error\" - conventional technical term\n- \"principled way\" - \"principled\" adds some emphasis\n- \"gradually aligning\" - \"gradually\" adds limited value\n- \"explicit, shared specification\" - appropriate technical language\n- \"structured representation that externalizes what was previously opaque\" - good technical language\n- \"concrete achievement descriptors\" - \"concrete\" is flagged in the rubric as an unnecessary modifier\n- \"transparent and controllable alignment\" - \"transparent\" and \"controllable\" are technical terms here, not empty modifiers\n\nMetaphors:\n- \"black box\" - conventional technical metaphor, acceptable\n- \"foundation for negotiation\" - slight metaphor but acceptable\n\n\n- \"creating the appearance of personalized assistance\" - this phrasing effectively distinguishes appearance from reality without unnecessary embellishment\n\nVoice:\n- Generally uses active voice with clear agents: \"RubricLLM infers...\", \"the system scores...\", \"Users can update...\"\n- Some passive: \"are increasingly used\" in opening\n\nSeveral weak points stand out: \"concrete achievement descriptors\" relies on a flagged modifier, \"particularly problematic\" leans subjective, and \"nuanced considerations\" and \"gradually aligning\" contribute minimal semantic value. This lands at Proficient (75%) - the core requirements are met, but these modifiers and slight subjective framings prevent a higher score.\n\nPurpose-Before-Mechanism Organization shows strong execution. The draft consistently states goals before describing how they work: \"To address the opacity of preference learning, we introduce RubricLLM\" establishes intent first, then mechanism. The pattern repeats with \"This externalization enables inspection: users can examine...\" and \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation through their dual role.\" Later, when validation reveals incomplete preferences, the response is framed as \"To address these misalignments, RubricLLM supports bidirectional refinement\" - again, purpose precedes the technical description.\n\nThe branching workflow section follows the same structure with \"To support exploration without commitment, RubricLLM introduces a branching workflow.\" While some passages like \"During generation, the rubric conditions model suggestions...During evaluation, the system scores drafts...\" present mechanism first, these appear after the overarching purpose has already been established. The consistent use of \"To address...\" and \"To support...\" constructions throughout demonstrates exemplary adherence to this principle.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Logical Flow and Explicit Connections (28%)\n\nLooking for:\n- Explicit backward references to prior arguments\n- Clear signaling of logical relationships\n- Solution elements mapping\n\nThe draft builds connections systematically across sections. Para 2 explicitly references para 1's adaptation mechanism as a \"black box,\" then para 3 identifies the resulting challenge and notes that existing approaches don't fully address it. Para 4 directly references para 2's opacity concern while introducing rubrics as a solution, with phrases like \"This externalization enables inspection\" and \"Beyond inspection, rubrics enable validation and negotiation\" creating clear logical progression. Para 5 continues this chain by referencing the validation mechanisms from para 4 and how they might reveal misalignments, then uses \"To address these misalignments\" to signal the next development. Each section explicitly connects back to prior arguments rather than introducing ideas in isolation.\n\nThe problem-solution structure reinforces this coherence: the inability to inspect preferences gets solved through externalization, the verification problem gets addressed through rubric validation, and the negotiation gap gets bridged through establishing foundations for dialogue. Every major problem statement has a corresponding solution presented later, making the argument feel complete and purposeful. This represents exemplary backward referencing throughout.\n\nPara 1 sets the scene with LLM usage in writing tasks but doesn't actually articulate the paper's core argument about conversational adaptation and its hidden mechanisms. Para 2 does this much better—it directly states the central tension between observable behavior changes and invisible preference drivers. Para 3 mentions existing alignment methods learn preferences implicitly, yet misses the crucial point that these approaches fundamentally fail at making preferences transparent. Para 4 begins introducing the proposed system to tackle this opacity problem.\n\nThe system makes implicit preferences both inspectable and negotiable through structured rubrics. Para 5 identifies a key limitation—that inferred preferences may be incomplete or outdated—but frames this as a problem rather than emphasizing the bidirectional refinement process that actually solves it. Overall, the summaries capture the technical contributions in paragraphs 2 and 4, but the framing in 1, 3, and 5 misses the argumentative thrust, suggesting room for improvement in how I'm synthesizing the paper's logic.\n\nLooking at precision and interpretive synthesis, I need to examine whether the summaries explain why these contributions matter and what their implications are for the broader problem of preference alignment.\n\nThe strongest examples show interpretive depth: explaining that context memory creates an illusion of personalization, that externalization enables inspection rather than inference, and that evaluative feedback establishes grounds for negotiation when interpretations diverge. These go beyond describing what happens to explaining what it means.\n\nThe solution descriptions are fairly comprehensive—rubric structure with dimensions and weights, the dual role in generation and evaluation, bidirectional refinement in both directions, and the branching workflow. However, there's some redundancy between paragraphs 2 and 3 around opacity and validation that could be tightened. The problem sections could also be more concise to make room for deeper interpretive synthesis about why these mechanisms matter for the core challenge of making preferences negotiable.\n\nFor problem-solution alignment, the draft maps well: the inability to inspect preferences connects to \"makes implicit preferences inspectable,\" the inability to verify interpretation aligns with \"allows users to validate whether the rubric matches their actual goals,\" and the inability to negotiate connects to \"foundation for negotiation when interpretations diverge.\" The terminology tracks across problem and solution sections fairly consistently, though some terms like \"validate\" and \"negotiate\" appear in multiple contexts that could be clarified.\n\nNow calculating the overall score: Academic Register Consistency contributes 16.5 points (75% of 22), Purpose-Before-Mechanism Organization adds the full 20 points, Logical Flow provides 28 points, Topic Sentence Completeness adds 5.25 points, and Precision and Interpretive Synthesis contributes 15 points.\n\nThe Problem-Solution Alignment scores perfectly at 3 points, bringing the total to 87.75—a strong performance in the 80-89 range."
