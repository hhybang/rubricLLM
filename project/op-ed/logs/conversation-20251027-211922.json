To make sure we're aligned, I need to understand a few things first:\n\n**Key Questions:**\n1. **What's your main argument or angle?** For example:\n   - Coffee culture has gone too far (critique of $8 lattes)\n   - Coffee is underappreciated for its health benefits\n   - The coffee industry needs sustainability reforms\n   - Something else entirely?\n\n2. **Who's your target audience?** (General newspaper readers? Coffee industry insiders? Your local community?)\n\n3. **What tone are you going for?** (Serious and research-backed? Witty and observational? Provocative?)\n\n4. **Do you have any specific examples, data, or personal experiences** you want to include?\n\n5. **What's the publication venue**, if you know? (This affects style and expectations)\n\nOnce I understand your vision, I can help you craft a compelling 200-word piece. Do you already have any ideas, a rough angle, or even a sentence or two to start with?"

      "content": "Great! Here's a draft to work with:\n\n---\n\n**When Did Coffee Become a Luxury Good?**\n\nSomewhere between the French press and the oat milk foam, we lost the plot. Coffee—once the democratic fuel of students, truckers, and office workers alike—has transformed into a lifestyle accessory with a price tag to match.\n\nWalk into any urban coffee shop and you'll encounter a menu that reads like a wine list. A basic latte now costs $6, while specialty drinks breach $8 or more. We've normalized spending $40 a week on what is essentially hot bean water with milk.\n\nThe defense is always the same: you're paying for craft, for ethically-sourced beans, for the \"experience.\" But let's be honest—most of us are drinking it in a paper cup while rushing to work, not savoring it in a ceramic vessel while contemplating life.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with good coffee. But when an entire generation can't afford housing yet drops $200 monthly at cafés, something has curdled. Coffee culture hasn't elevated our taste—it's just convinced us that basic caffeine delivery requires a small fortune.\n\nMaybe it's time we sobered up.\n\n---\n\n**Does this capture the tone and argument you're going for?** Any specific examples or points you'd want to add/change?"

  "analysis": "\nThe user wants to write an op-ed critiquing expensive coffee culture (\"Coffee culture has gone too far\" with the $8 latte angle). This is a 200-word op-ed, which is quite short—essentially 2-3 tight paragraphs.\n\nGoing through interaction principles:\n1. I still have some uncertainty (target publication, specific examples they want to use, their personal connection to the topic) but I have enough to start drafting\n2. I should provide concrete text they can work with, not just abstract advice\n3. The 200-word constraint is critical and must be respected\n4. I shouldn't invent specific prices or statistics without their input\n5. Since they haven't provided a draft yet, I need to establish an appropriate op-ed tone—likely accessible, punchy, perhaps slightly sardonic given the critique angle\n6. The \"critique\" value should be balanced—criticize the trend without being elitist or dismissive of people who enjoy nice coffee\n7. After providing a draft, I should ask if this captures their intent\n\nI should provide a full or nearly-full draft that they can edit, since they've given me enough direction. I'll keep it tight, punchy, and focused on the economic/cultural absurdity angle while avoiding being condescending.\n"
