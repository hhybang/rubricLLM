Before we start, a few quick questions to make it as effective as possible:\n\n1. **Who's your target audience?** (e.g., business owners, office workers, general newspaper readers, HR professionals)\n\n2. **What's the publication or context?** (local paper, LinkedIn, company newsletter, class assignment)\n\n3. **Tone preference?** Should this be:\n   - Research/data-driven\n   - Personal and anecdotal\n   - Humorous/light\n   - Serious business case\n\n4. **Any specific angles you want to hit?** (mental health, productivity, company culture, employee retention, etc.)\n\n5. **Do you have data/studies to reference**, or should I mark spots as `[TODO: add citation]`?\n\nThese details will help me suggest the strongest argument structure and word choices for your 200-word limit. \n\nOnce you let me know, I can either:\n- Draft a complete version for you to revise, or\n- Work from any partial draft/bullet points you already have\n\nWhat works best for you?"

      "content": "Quick clarification needed: You mentioned both \"general newspaper readers\" and \"company newsletter\" - which is it? This affects the tone significantly:\n\n**Company newsletter** = I'd write for your colleagues, maybe more informal, focus on \"our workplace\"\n\n**General newspaper** = Broader audience, more formal, universal workplace argument\n\nAssuming you meant **company newsletter to employees**, here's a draft:\n\n---\n\n**It's Time to Welcome Dogs to Our Workplace**\n\nThe case for office dogs isn't just feel-good fluff—it's backed by compelling data on employee wellbeing and performance.\n\nStudies show that employees in dog-friendly offices report [TODO: add % decrease] lower stress levels throughout the workday `[TODO: cite study]`. The simple act of petting a dog reduces cortisol, our primary stress hormone, while increasing oxytocin, which promotes bonding and calm `[TODO: cite research]`. In high-pressure environments, these micro-breaks can prevent burnout.\n\nProductivity gains are equally impressive. Companies with office dog policies report [TODO: add % or metric] improved employee satisfaction and retention `[TODO: cite survey/report]`. Dogs encourage brief movement breaks—essential for focus and creativity—and create informal social interactions that strengthen team cohesion.\n\nConcerns about allergies and distractions are manageable through designated dog-free zones and clear behavior policies. [TODO: add example company] successfully implemented such guidelines with [TODO: outcome] `[TODO: cite case study]`.\n\nThe evidence is clear: office dogs aren't a perk; they're a strategic investment in mental health and productivity. Let's explore what a pilot program could look like here.\n\n---\n\n**Word count: 184** (leaving 16 words for citation details)\n\nWhat needs adjusting?"
