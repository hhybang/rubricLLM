[TODO: Citation - research showing reduced cortisol/stress hormones in presence of dogs] Studies consistently demonstrate that interaction with dogs reduces cortisol levels and increases oxytocin production, the hormone associated with bonding and stress relief.

The brief mental breaks that come from interacting with dogs—whether their own or a colleague's—mirror the benefits of walking meetings or meditation breaks that HR departments already promote.\n\nThe professionalism concern deserves direct address. Professionalism isn't undermined by dogs; it's defined by results, communication, and respect. A well-behaved dog resting under a desk during a video conference projects no less competence than the houseplants, family photos, or coffee mugs that populate our workspaces. In fact, dog-friendly policies signal a mature workplace culture—one that trusts employees to manage their responsibilities and values outcomes over performative formality. For client-facing concerns, designated dog-free zones for meetings can easily address any hesitation.\n\nThe allergy question requires practical policy rather than blanket prohibition. Approximately [TODO: Citation - percentage of population with dog allergies], yet we successfully accommodate this through designated floors, enhanced air filtration, and clear communication. Companies manage far more complex accommodations daily; treating this as an insurmountable barrier reveals lack of imagination rather than legitimate constraint.\n\nThe post-pandemic workplace demands rethinking assumptions about what professional environments look like. Employees who experienced the mental health benefits of working alongside their pets during remote work won't easily surrender that support. For HR departments struggling with retention and wellness initiatives, dog-friendly policies represent a low-cost, high-impact investment that addresses root causes rather than symptoms.\n\nThe question isn't whether dogs belong in professional settings.

  "analysis": "\nThe user is expressing satisfaction with the current draft. They're highlighting what's working:\n- Tone is persuasive yet professional (matches their request for \"serious and data-driven\")\n- Claims backed by evidence (even though placeholders, the structure is there)\n- Flow with arguments first, counterarguments later\n\nAccording to Interaction Principle #7, I should \"solicit feedback selectively - only ask about likes/dislikes after major changes, full drafts, or when user intent is unclear.\" The user has just provided positive feedback on a full draft, so this is NOT the time to ask for more feedback.\n\nThe user seems satisfied with the current state. My role now is to:\n1. Acknowledge their feedback\n2. Confirm we're done or ask if there's anything else they need\n3. Perhaps offer next steps (like tips for finding those citations)\n\nThis is a natural closing point in the collaboration unless they want to continue refining.\n"
