  "analysis": "\nThe user is requesting a full draft of a 500-word op-ed arguing for dogs in offices. Let me work through this systematically:\n\n**Type of writing and purpose:**\n- Op-ed (opinion-editorial) = persuasive essay for publication, typically in newspapers or online platforms\n- Purpose: To convince readers (and potentially employers/policymakers) that allowing dogs in offices is beneficial\n- Genre conventions: Strong thesis, evidence-based arguments, engaging tone, practical consideration of counterarguments\n\n**Specific constraints and rubric criteria:**\n1. **Precise Word Count**: Must be exactly 500 words (high priority)\n2. **Data-Driven Evidence**: Need specific statistics, studies, percentages (high priority)\n3. **Persuasive Yet Accessible Tone**: Balance authority with readability for general public (high priority)\n4. **Focused Thematic Emphasis**: Need a clear main angle - user hasn't specified, so I should probably focus on a single compelling benefit rather than scattering arguments\n5. **Corporate Real-World Examples**: Include actual companies that have done this (medium priority)\n6. **Strong Headline-Driven Opening**: Need a compelling headline (medium priority)\n\n**Assessment of interaction principles:**\n1. **Clarifying questions**: I could ask about target publication, specific angle (productivity? mental health? culture?), audience (business leaders? general public?), or whether they want counterarguments addressed. However, the user asked for a \"full draft\" which suggests they want me to make reasonable decisions and produce something complete.\n2. **Concrete line-level edits**: Not applicable yet since there's no existing draft\n3. **Respect constraints**: 500 words exactly, follow rubric\n4. **Don't invent facts**: I'll need to be careful here - I can reference general knowledge about workplace dog programs, but should mark anything that needs verification\n5. **Match style/tone**: Op-ed style - authoritative, engaging, evidence-based\n6. **Balance constraints**: All rubric items seem compatible\n7. **Solicit feedback**: After providing full draft, I should ask what works/doesn't work\n\n**Missing or unclear information:**\n- Target audience (business leaders? employees? general public?) - I'll assume general public/business audience mix\n- Specific angle/emphasis - I'll focus on mental health and productivity as this aligns with the rubric's prior example\n- Publication target - I'll write for a general-interest publication like a major newspaper\n- Whether to address counterarguments - I'll include brief acknowledgment since this strengthens op-eds\n\n**Most useful feedback approach:**\nSince they want a full draft, I should:\n- Provide a complete 500-word piece\n- Include headline\n- Use data-driven evidence with specific stats (even if I need to mark some for verification)\n- Include real company examples\n- Focus thematically (I'll center on mental health/wellbeing with productivity as secondary)\n- Annotate every section with appropriate rubric tags\n- After the draft, ask about what's working and what needs adjustment\n\n**Annotation plan:**\n- Headline: Criterion 6\n- Word count: Will verify at end for Criterion 1\n- Any statistics/data: Criterion 2\n- Tone/accessibility: Criterion 3\n- Main thematic focus: Criterion 4\n- Company examples: Criterion 5\n"
