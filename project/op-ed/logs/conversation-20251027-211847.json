To make sure we're aligned, I need to understand a few things first:\n\n**Key Questions:**\n1. **What's your main argument or angle?** For example:\n   - Coffee culture has gone too far (critique of $8 lattes)\n   - Coffee is underappreciated for its health benefits\n   - The coffee industry needs sustainability reforms\n   - Something else entirely?\n\n2. **Who's your target audience?** (General newspaper readers? Coffee industry insiders? Your local community?)\n\n3. **What tone are you going for?** (Serious and research-backed? Witty and observational? Provocative?)\n\n4. **Do you have any specific examples, data, or personal experiences** you want to include?\n\n5. **What's the publication venue**, if you know? (This affects style and expectations)\n\nOnce I understand your vision, I can help you craft a compelling 200-word piece. Do you already have any ideas, a rough angle, or even a sentence or two to start with?"

  "analysis": "\nThis is a very open-ended request for a 200-word op-ed about coffee. Let me work through the interaction principles:\n\n1. **Clarifying questions needed**: I'm missing critical information:\n   - What's the main argument or angle? (health benefits? environmental impact? cultural significance? economics?)\n   - Who's the target audience? (general newspaper readers? coffee enthusiasts? policymakers?)\n   - What's the publication venue? (local paper? trade publication? blog?)\n   - What tone is desired? (serious? humorous? contrarian?)\n   - Any specific constraints beyond word count?\n\n2. **Concrete edits**: Can't provide line-level edits yet - there's no draft to work with\n\n3. **Respect constraints**: Only constraint stated is 200 words\n\n4. **Don't invent facts**: Critical here - I shouldn't make up statistics or claims about coffee without user input\n\n5. **Match style/tone**: Unknown at this stage\n\n6. **Balance constraints/values**: Need to understand what matters most to the user\n\n7. **Solicit feedback**: This is the right moment to ask clarifying questions since the assignment is so open-ended\n\nThe user said \"co-write,\" which suggests they want collaboration, not for me to write it entirely. I should ask key questions to help us develop this together rather than producing a full draft that might miss the mark.\n"
