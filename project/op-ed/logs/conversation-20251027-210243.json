Before we start, a few quick questions to make it as effective as possible:\n\n1. **Who's your target audience?** (e.g., business owners, office workers, general newspaper readers, HR professionals)\n\n2. **What's the publication or context?** (local paper, LinkedIn, company newsletter, class assignment)\n\n3. **Tone preference?** Should this be:\n   - Research/data-driven\n   - Personal and anecdotal\n   - Humorous/light\n   - Serious business case\n\n4. **Any specific angles you want to hit?** (mental health, productivity, company culture, employee retention, etc.)\n\n5. **Do you have data/studies to reference**, or should I mark spots as `[TODO: add citation]`?\n\nThese details will help me suggest the strongest argument structure and word choices for your 200-word limit. \n\nOnce you let me know, I can either:\n- Draft a complete version for you to revise, or\n- Work from any partial draft/bullet points you already have\n\nWhat works best for you?"
