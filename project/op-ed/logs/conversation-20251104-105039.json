Rubric priorities:\n   - HIGH: Substantive topic sentences (name mechanisms like spatial reasoning, cognitive development)\n   - HIGH: Evidence-backed claims (PROBLEM: user has no research)\n   - HIGH: Quantitative precision (PROBLEM: no data available)\n   - HIGH: Provocative yet credible (but mainstream tone requested - balance needed)\n   - MEDIUM: Strategic argument flow (problem → evidence → counterarguments)\n\n4. **Do not invent facts:** CRITICAL - user has no research. Must use [TODO: ...] markers extensively for all claims requiring evidence per rubric requirements.\n\n5. **Match style and tone:** Mainstream, accessible to parents, not overly provocative.\n\n6. **Balance constraints:** Tension between rubric's evidence requirements and lack of available research. Solution: draft structure that shows WHERE evidence would go, mark clearly with TODOs.\n\n7. **Solicit feedback selectively:** After providing full draft with TODO markers.\n\n**Stated Constraints:**\n- 400 words\n- Elementary school focus\n- Free building time (not structured curriculum)\n- Parent audience\n- Mainstream tone\n- No research currently available\n\n**Audience and Purpose:**\n- Parents of elementary students\n- Goal: convince them to advocate for LEGO time in classrooms\n- General advocacy (not responding to specific crisis)\n\n**Missing Information:**\n- All research citations\n- All quantified outcomes\n- Specific examples of school implementations\n- Data on cognitive benefits\n\n**Planned Response:**\nWill produce a 400-word draft following the rubric structure (problem → evidence → counterarguments) but with extensive [TODO: ...] markers showing exactly what research/evidence is needed.
