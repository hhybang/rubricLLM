Strategic Argument Flow (15%), Provocative Yet Credible Tone (15%), and Strategic Dramatic Language (10%) all received explicit positive feedback, maintaining their importance with weights reflecting the emphasis shown in conversation. Claim Defensibility (5%) preserved from previous rubric but receives lower weight as no new evidence emerged in this conversation about choosing between dramatic vs. defensible claims.",

They're comfortable with bold, provocative claims as long as evidence scaffolding is present. The progression across three drafts shows they value iterative refinement toward greater specificity—more precise citations, more technical terminology, more concrete examples. The [TODO] placeholder format reveals they want complete citation architecture upfront, even when studies aren't verified, suggesting they think about evidence structure while drafting. They don't need explicit instructions for each improvement; providing rubric-based feedback ('score should be lower') is sufficient for them to understand what needs strengthening. Future work should maintain the high bar for opening sentences—every paragraph needs mechanism-first language, no exceptions."
