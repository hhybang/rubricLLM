What models do you expect to use and what do you expect to use them for?\n\nFor context, Tinker is a flexible API for fine-tuning language models. It empowers researchers and hackers to experiment with models by giving them control over the algorithms and data while we handle the complexity of distributed training. Tinker advances our mission of enabling more people to do research on cutting-edge models and customize them to their needs. Tinker lets you fine-tune a range of large and small open-weight models, including large mixture-of-experts models such as Qwen-235B-A22B. Switching from a small model to a large one is as simple as changing a single string in your Python code. Tinker is a managed service that runs on internal clusters and training infrastructure. They handle scheduling, resource allocation, and failure recovery. This allows users to get small or large runs started immediately, without worrying about managing infrastructure. They use LoRA so that they can share the same pool of compute between multiple training runs, lowering costs. This is the site to their documentation on Reinforcement Learning (https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/rl)\n\nMy research project is building a better environment for users to work with LLM in writing tasks. We do so by feeding in to an LLM the past conversation the LLM had with a user on a writing task and asking the model to generate a rubric based on the conversation. The rubric should capture users' writing goals, style, etc, best capturing the users' ways of writing. Then, this rubric would be used as a reward function for the LLM to make even better responses for the user so that the user has a better experience with the LLM on the writing task. This rubric would be refined after each session between the user and the LLM, better aligning the rubric to the user which will thus align the model to the user. The writing task would be on the same realm so the intent stays the same (like the task on writing different op-ed pieces or different professional emails — there would be a rubric for each task in this realm)."

After each writing session, the system analyzes the LLM-user dialogue to generate a rubric capturing what the user values in their writing—their objectives, stylistic preferences, and priorities. This rubric then serves as a reward model to fine-tune the LLM. The rubrics refine iteratively across sessions, allowing me to investigate how progressive personalization affects alignment quality while keeping the system specialized to specific writing domains (e.g., op-eds, professional emails).\n\nI expect to work primarily with **larger models (70B+ parameters)**, as our preliminary iterations showed that model scale significantly affects both rubric generation quality and writing assistance. I plan to **experiment across multiple model sizes and architectures**, including models like Qwen-235B-A22B, to systematically evaluate their performance as writing assistants—including providing feedback, generating rubrics, and improving after RL fine-tuning. I'll use **LoRA** for efficient fine-tuning, enabling multiple concurrent experiments across different users and writing domains.\n\nTinker is essential for this research because it provides the infrastructure to **fine-tune large models using LoRA with rubric-based reward functions**—the core mechanism for aligning models to individual users. Without access to substantial compute resources, Tinker's managed RL training infrastructure and shared compute pools make this research feasible. This allows me to focus on the research questions—how to capture user intent in rubrics and translate that into effective reward signals for better user alignment.\n\n---\n\nHow's this?",
