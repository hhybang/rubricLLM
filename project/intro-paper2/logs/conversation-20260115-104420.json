The interface allows users to collaborate with an LLM in a chat interface where they can draft and revise documents, while the system automatically infers or manually creates rubrics that capture what the user values in their writing—including criteria like clarity, argumentation, and tone, each with weighted importance and four achievement levels (Beginning, Developing, Proficient, Exemplary). Users can edit drafts directly in the interface, and the system can analyze those edits to suggest rubric updates, creating a feedback loop between writing preferences and evaluation criteria. The user can also make changes on the rubric to better align the model to what the user wants, allowing there to be an interpretable medium for both the user and the LLM."

Before I draft an introduction, I have a few questions that will help me tailor it appropriately:\n\n**About audience and venue:**\n1. What venue or field is this paper targeting? (e.g., CHI, UIST, ACL, EMNLP, an education journal, etc.) This will shape the framing and assumed background knowledge.\n\n**About the contribution:**\n2. What do you see as the **primary contribution**? For instance:\n   - The rubric as an interpretable, editable \"contract\" between user and AI?\n   - The feedback loop that infers preferences from edits?\n   - A user study showing improved outcomes?\n   - The system design itself?\n\n3. Is there a specific **problem or gap** you want to open with? (e.g., \"Current AI writing tools are black boxes,\" \"Personalization in AI assistants is underexplored,\" etc.)\n\n**About scope and constraints:**\n4. Roughly how long should the introduction be? (e.g., ~1 page, ~500 words?)\n5. Do you have any existing draft material—even fragments or bullet points—you'd like me to work from?\n\nOnce I understand these, I can give you a concrete draft to react to rather than something generic.",

They've given me a description of what the system does, but I need more context to write an effective introduction.\n\nLet me identify what I know and what I need to clarify:\n\n**What I know:**\n- RubricLLM is an AI writing assistant\n- It uses personalized rubrics with criteria (clarity, argumentation, tone, etc.)\n- Rubrics have weighted importance and four achievement levels\n- There's a feedback loop: edits → rubric updates\n- Users can edit rubrics directly for interpretability\n- It's meant to be an \"interpretable medium\" for both user and LLM\n\n**What I need to know to write a good introduction:**\n1. **Audience**: Is this for HCI venue? NLP? Education? This affects framing and terminology.\n2. **Paper type**: Is this a systems paper? User study? Both?\n3. **Key contribution/framing**: What's the main angle? Is it about:\n   - Personalization in AI writing tools?\n   - Interpretability/transparency in AI assistance?\n   - The rubric as a boundary object between human and AI?\n   - Something else?\n4. **Length expectations**: How long should the intro be?\n5. **Do they have any draft started?**: They might have something partial they want me to build on.\n6. **What problem does this solve?**: What's wrong with existing AI writing assistants that this addresses?\n\nI should ask clarifying questions before attempting a draft, per my principles. However, I could also provide a rough starting point to get the conversation going - but that might be premature without knowing the venue/audience.\n\nLet me ask focused questions to reduce uncertainty."

Open with the problem: AI writing assistants personalize through conversation history, but this is opaque and uncontrollable\n2. Articulate the gap: Users can't see, understand, or edit how the AI \"knows\" them\n3. Introduce the solution: A rubric as an interpretable, editable medium that makes personalization explicit\n4. Preview RubricLLM as the system that embodies this\n\n**Structure I'm thinking:**\n- Para 1: Set up the promise and problem of AI writing assistants + personalization\n- Para 2: Dig into why conversational history as personalization is problematic (black box, no control)\n- Para 3: Introduce the idea of an interpretable medium - what would it look like?\n- Para 4: Introduce RubricLLM and preview contributions\n\nLet me draft this. I should keep it around 4-5 paragraphs for a typical CHI/COLM intro. I'll make it concrete but leave room for them to react and revise.\n\nI should also note what's missing - they might need:\n- Related work positioning (what prior attempts exist?)\n- Specific claims about what they evaluated/found\n- Whether there's a user study or technical evaluation"
